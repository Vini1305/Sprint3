10/19/2009;pduggs;I bought it new. First foreign car I have ever owned (grew up in Detroit) and it is by far the best car. Looks great. It is very quick and handles nice. No problems with car and it now has 48,000. I have been told by a mechanic friend the key to German cars is you must maintain them very well. ;Looks, power, and the many safety features.;volkswagen_passat
10/15/2009;Kory;"I have to say that this is the worst car that I have ever owned. I traded my 1992 Saturn SL1 for this car. My Saturn was definitely a ""no frills"" car that was perfect for my needs, which at the time was reliable transportation to and from school and work. My husband wanted a larger sedan. Our VW ran great for the first 15000 miles, then it was in the shop constantly. The car stalled frequently, lost power steering, had all sorts of electrical problems. A recurring crack in the fuel line was the last straw and we traded it for a Saturn Vue. I know others who have had many electrical problems with these cars. They are pretty but not reliable. I will never buy a VW again. ";Looks nice, but not reliable.;volkswagen_passat
09/21/2009;Nepsis; First, I had to write just because several people mentioned interior squeaks in dash. YES, I had the same problem after a few miles and there is a simple fix. I purchased a can of silicone spray and using the spray tube simply lube all the seams around ctr console and wipe off excess. Can said safe for plastics and I had NO harmful effect to dash. Do this 2-3 X's a week apart and be sure to get all the seems, even where black sidewall next to your legs meets ctr console. No more dash noise and silicone smell will fade shortly. On a side note I got 58,000 on original tires but did have cupping/noise also. MPG awesome w/35- 36MPG on my commute common. Otherwise A++++ mechanically. ;Interior finish, Overall Look & nice handling. to computer shutdown at 135 MPH and handles very well at high speed. (Typical of Austrian/German Autobahn designed cars, eh?) Have had it First car I have bought that EXCEEDED mpg rating on window. Great balance of performance and MPG for a commuter. ;volkswagen_passat
08/25/2009;passatvw;I owned Volkswagen 2006 jetta it was shaking so I traded it for 2007 passat it driving me crazy I had new tires and balance done but car shakes stearing wheel its not shaking but whole car does, I think for new car it wasnt supposed to shake, it feel like hitting car jumping as soon as it gets to 40 mph, ,can anyone tell me if it has same problem with volkwagen, overall car starts fast like hell, and when I put cd in I wait for ever to start, it doesnt start in 20 min or more, ,and dash board sounds so annoying, like, it fallin apart, let me know if this is normal for Volkswagen since both jetta and passat shake while driving, jetta had good cd player,;dashboard,,and i love blue lights,very cold ac,,;volkswagen_passat
07/11/2009;creeky;"07 Passat sedan recently purchased (20K), looks great, handles well, but is the creekiest car I have ever owned. The dealer tried twice to fix the unacceptable noises in and around the dash/glove box/console to no avail.Is this typical for the 2007 passat? The service department said I was ""very particular"" even though they acknowledged that there are ""minor squeaks, which, by the way, are noticeable on even the smoothest of roads.";;volkswagen_passat
07/11/2009;jwilliamsoh;Long story short. I used to own a company and drove MB as a rule. Now things are very different so I still wanted German and went with a VW. The top part of the engine has been rebuilt twice as the timing chain broke twice. Now I was a LITTLE late on a couple oil changes; like 2k miles, not THAT big of a deal (for other cars). Now with 78k miles the car is starting to tick again and it is under 3 years old. Now I have driven a lot of miles but drive (slow) due to some points I drive the speed limit. Take off NORMAL, stop normal, no driving fast or racing. Also because funds are tight I need to get the most out of the gas. I average (for the past 8k miles) 23.7 mpg.;volkswagen_passat
07/08/2009;REB;Best car ever owned and I have owned many!!;Perfect ride has 27k and still runs like new. As long as you take car of your car it will take care of you! ;volkswagen_passat
07/06/2009;MarkusK;I purchased my Passat in 01/08 as a 'Certified Pre-Owned' with 15k miles and have driven it 18k since then. After the test drive, I was hooked by the performance and feel of the 2.0T engine. Also, the build quality appeared very solid. For road trips with the family, we often leave the other car (SUV) at home and enjoy the ride in the Passat. Gas mileage can exceed 30 mpg highway, even when fully loaded. However, a concern and disappointment is the lack of reliability. AC failed at 22k. A temperature sensor almost left me stranded at 26k. At 32k, an ignition coil failure resulted in the need for a tow truck. The warranty and my dealership have kept me and my wallet 'sane' (for now).;I love the power delivery of the 2.0T engine. It works well with the six speed auto trans. This drivetrain is far ahead of many competitors and combines performance and frugality. Together with the sophisticated suspension and well sized breaks, the Passat is an attractive package for a family car.;volkswagen_passat
06/05/2009;Wniece;Squeaks, rattles and all sorts of problems! The rubber seals in the doors squeak, the dashs sounds like it is coming apart and numerous mechanical issues! Worse car I have ever owned. And, the dealer can not find the Moroney Act sticker for the car, which is required for every new or untitled car sold in the US. Keep getting the brush off. They also sold it as new, only to find out it had 4,530 miles on it already! Does anyone know who to contact to take legal action against the dealership and VW...clearly they have broken the law and it is punishable up to a $250,000 fine. I guess one positive is that is looks really nice when it is cleaned up!;The way it looks and the wheels. Stereo is good too.;volkswagen_passat
05/30/2009;Gene;This is our third Passat (first a 1993) and it is the best. The car feels like a much bigger and more expense automobile. No problems and only expense is the scheduled maintenance. I alternate between Plus and High Test gasoline and runs great. I was most impressed by the highway MPG. I always get between 31 and 32 MPG with one trip turning in 35. I would recommend changing the oil more often than VW recommends. 10,000 miles seems a little long.;ride, looks and gas mileage;volkswagen_passat
04/30/2007;Steven;The one I bought is NOT like the one I test drove. Mine drives like a boat, or more accurately, my grandmother's Caddie. This does NOT drive like previous Passats (I've owned three). I don't know what the rationale is, but it is NOT the car you've heard of;" it's redesigned by VERY old folks. Do yourself a favor: get the BMW 328i for the same price. If you ""must"" have a VW, get the sports package. The next four years are going to be the most miserable driving years of my life. I plan to drive my wife's older car as much as possible.The upgraded stereo is great. Really.";volkswagen_passat
04/30/2007;HARDCORE VWer;I have had 11+ Volkswagens and loved them all. The outside is very well done on the new Passat and the interior is very large and elegant compared to the older Passats. The car is surprisingly nimble being so large (bigger than a 3 series). The handling is great on my base Passat and the fuel economy isn't bad (it does have a big gas tank though). ;Turbo engine, interior trim, and exterior design.;volkswagen_passat
04/27/2007;Pedro;I have owned this vehicle for 2 months, and have enjoyed every minute of it. My 2003 Passat was a great car, but this one is even greater. It feels sporty, yet roomy, and offer great gas mileage. ;Navigation system, 18'' wheels, and electromagnetic steering. ;volkswagen_passat
04/24/2007;golfool81;I have owned this car for a year. It is great there is a practical side with a sports car drive. It is fun to drive. Great car.;XM radio and shift ability. Handling, too.;volkswagen_passat
04/17/2007;Missy;I bought this car a few weeks ago,and love it. It is so fast, the take off speed is impressive. I love the package 1 upgrade, it had everything I wanted. I love this car, me and my mom both have one now.;Heated seats, speed, all the new gadgets.;volkswagen_passat
04/13/2007;peabody;This wagon justs keeps getting better and better every day. Mileage is up to 32 mpg on highway and getting better after 5K oil change. Get the Luxury 2 package to truly enjoy all the features. Wife loves the roominess, safety and overall luxuary feel. The 2.0 Turbo engine is amazing. I'm making up reasons just to go for a drive. Dollar for dollar, the Passat out classes, out performs, and gets better mpg than anything out there. This is a sleeper that needs to be considered before spending more on Audi/BMW/Volvo, or settling for less.;Power liftgate (puppies love it). Sirius radio - I got a lifetime subscription. Steering wheel controls. Auto everything!;volkswagen_passat
04/06/2007;Neil;Just bought the 2007 Passat Wolfsburg edition and we love it. I take my time when purchasing vehicles and the price/quality of the Passat Wolfsburg just plain beat out the competition! German engineering made the difference. Plus, only 6000 Wolfsburg are going to be made which is nice. Compare this vehicle's options with the Japanese versions and they don't compare for the price. A great family sedan with nice features - if you can find one left, get it!;2.0T engine is very quick. Wolfsburg added features are nice. Trunk space for golfer. Rear passenger room. Heated seats and satellite radio.;volkswagen_passat
03/28/2007;James;After spending almost $40,000 on this Passat, I am very angry with how many trim rattles this has. I previously owned a 2002 Passat motion, this was far better in the interior quality department. It really does go to show that build quality is still an issue for VW. I will be spending my generous budget elsewhere in 2 years. ;The bi-xeon adaptive lights are cool. I love the V6, but hate that no one offers after market engine upgrades.;volkswagen_passat
03/26/2007;Timone;I have had my new Passat for almost a month now and I love it. This is my second VW, and it's so good to be back. It's a definite driver's car. It was not the fastest car I considered (G35x, A4, & 328XI) but this car was a lot more car for the money. The one that came closest was the smaller Audi A4 2.0T. If you can get over the lack of Quattro and lack of the 4 rings on the grill - buy a VW instead! Very German, handles great, roomier than the others, and the 2.0T engine is real tourquey and fun. Love the 6spd DSG transmission too. With the Sport mode, I'd pick it over a manual transmission any day, when factoring in practicality.;DSG transmission, 10 air bags. Build quality, fit and finish. The doors sound like they should be on a tank when you close them.;volkswagen_passat
03/09/2007;tk;This is a well designed car with balance between safety, roominess, performance, practicality and gas mileage. It has good acceleration except there is a lag at <5 mph. It also has loads of storage. It's much better than driving a minivan.;The excellent steering, good gas mileage, and liftgate.;volkswagen_passat
03/02/2007;Mongo;My 2003 Passat was a great vehicle in every way. Its speed, handling, comfort, quality, reliability...every one was top notch. That's not to say that it was the fastest or most comfortable car ever, just that the car met or exceeded my desires in each of the categories. There was absolutely nothing about the 2003 that I disliked, but when I first sat in the 2007 model I knew it was only a matter of time. I'm extremely tall, and the Passats have been good tall-person vehicles for a long time. The 2007 model offers me even more legroom with no loss in headroom, and more thigh support from the driver's seat. That's a great combination for me. So far, the car's been bulletproof.;The Tornado Red exterior. Seriously...I usually buy the least awful color for a car, but this time I actually got a color I wanted. More importantly, though, are roominess, comfort, ergonomics, performance (especially on the highway), and (finally!) decent storage layout throughout the car.;volkswagen_passat
03/02/2007;Puzman;As an update to my previous review, we now have close to 10,000 miles on our '07 Passat wagon. Its gas mileage has decreased due to the installation of a bike rack on the roof. We're now averaging about 25 mpg, with mixed highway/urban/rural driving, which is still pretty good compared to all of the SUVs out there. I LOVE the interior of this car; its ergonomics are excellent and the heated base seats are awesome. There is no need for leather, IMHO. Power is abundant in the 2.0T engine. Floor it in S or Tiptronic modes and 60 comes VERY quickly. There is some torque steer, however. The handling is the one area where I could see an improvement- there is significant understeer, although the car feels composed at all speeds. My Passat has had no reliability issues.The driver's seat with power lumbar and heaters. Tiptronic shifter (though a 6-speed manual option in the wagon would be nice). The good base sound system. This vehicle provides a good balance of ride and handling. It has an incredible powertrain. ;volkswagen_passat
02/25/2007;gmh;I have only had this car for over a week but so far I have nothing bad to say about it - I look forward to driving it! This is my third VW after owning two Jettas. My wife and I considered other cars but could not find another manufacturer that offers everything you get with VW. I couldn't be more pleased with our decision and can't believe we even considered another brand. We also own a 2003 Audi Avant. The Passat is very similar to our Audi wagon but includes some nice upgrades and features. The 2.0T engine is phenomenal and I can feel the responsiveness over our 1.8T. Keep in mind our Audi has Quattro which has a completely different driving experience.;The engine and exterior styling of this car cannot be beat. In my opinion there is not a better looking car in this price range on the road today. The understated luxury speaks volumes over the muscular cheesy American options or the hyper articulated Japanese cars.;volkswagen_passat
02/19/2007;TX3Ni;I owned a 2000 Passat and absolutely hated it! The warranty only covered 24,000 miles, and the engine sludged. The service at the dealership was lousy. My wife decide she wanted a new car which is why I'm here again. VW Passat still has the same awful mess created in 2000, just a slicker version. Its reliability was terrible. I lost a lot of time taking it to dealer and getting a run around delay from VW USA. It looks nice but if you want a reliable CAR don't try a VW.;My wife though it looked cute.;volkswagen_passat
02/07/2007;TySawyer;I traded in my '04 Touareg for a loaded '07 Passat. Mostly because I drive so many miles a week it made more practical sense. I can honestly thank this car with my renewed love of driving! It is a driver's dream. Don't believe me? Go test drive one. As far as reliability, it's too early to say. But, on every other aspect I am SOLD. ;"I have the Sport #2 Package. It makes your Passat more luxurious and elegant than a BMW or Mercedes costing 10 to 15 thousand more. Oh, and the rear arm rest has a dogie door leading to the trunk so you can watch ""Rover"" in his pet carrier while you roll down the road.";volkswagen_passat
02/06/2007;Hambonevw3;I have owned VWs for the past 10 years and I must say VW out did itself with the 2007 Passat. Although the interior is not as flashy as the Toyota Camry it is simply and functional and yet classy. The 2.0T engine with the automatic transmission gives you more than enough power when you need it. The electronic steering gives you stability and no steering jar even when driving over the roughest roads. It has a smooth ride and minimal wind noise. Its rear seat room is overwhelming when compared to previous year Passats and its 60/40 rear folding seats are a plus. The price ($27,300) compared to other competitors like Camry and Accord was in my opinion and value when comparing all of the features, like the sunroof and heated seats.;Everything about this car is simply awesome. My favorite highlights include 6CD in dash stereo with satellite radio, electronic steering, and the power of the 2.0T engine.;volkswagen_passat
02/01/2007;Jasavage;The new '07 Passat is much better than I expected. It has a nice interior, excellent handling, some of the new features (push button start), and it is very roomy. VW has done a great job with this car. I owned '98 and '04 Passats and this one blows them away. I highly recommend it. ;The 6 CD changer in the dash is great.;volkswagen_passat
01/29/2007;big guy cool cars;I love the car, I enjoy driving it, and I like the way it looks, but it has some problems. I had the entire a/c replaced twice and down here in South Florida it just extremely uncomfortable. Luckily it was all covered. the other problem was that the radio knobs started peeling, but once again it was completely covered. Also, some turbo lag that is noticeable, but I still like the performance. After all that, I still smile when I press that accelerator and turn that extremely responsive steering wheel. This is my second Volkswagen and it definitely won't be my last. It is safe, good looking, has great performance, and most importantly it is very reliable in every situation.;The design, performance, room (I'm 6 foot 4, so I really need room), and the quality of the car.;volkswagen_passat
01/23/2007;Pat;This is the first time I have ever purchased a VW. The ride is very smooth. The 2.0L Turbo has much more power than you would think. I don't think the 0 - 60 time is far off from my 2004 Maxima SE. The 6 speed automatic is smooth shifting and the Tiptronic transmission works better than most of the manual over automatic shifters out there. The fit and finish of the car is as good as anything out there. I got the leather package and xenon adaptive headlights. It is still early, but this is a really well built car.;;volkswagen_passat
01/12/2007;Craig;I recently bought this vehicle after years of driving a mid-size SUV. I couldn't be happier with the performance and fuel economy. There's plenty of room for cargo once you put the back seats down. The instrumentation is great. The stereo is great, I just wish I would have the option of XM instead of Sirius. I am hoping for a long and beautiful relationship with my new Passat.;The good fuel economy, stereo, and instruments.;volkswagen_passat
01/04/2007;Paul Zelenkov;This Passat is nothing like the old model's build or design. This is the best car I have ever owned. The engine is very strong and the six speed tranny shifts smart and gets the power to the ground. The near 4,000 lb. weight and 4Motion make it a very good snow car in Denver on stock all season tires. It is a much better value than a BMW or an Audi. The controls are great. Subarus may be a better value, but the build and handling are superior in the German made VW vs. the Indiana made Subaru. With a light foot I have been getting 19 -20 mpg in town and 27 -28 mpg highway. ;The strong brakes, stability control, easy controls, acceleration, handling, quiet, powerful, heated seats, strong heat in the rear seats, and the automatic rear hatch;volkswagen_passat
12/20/2006;charles edmundson;The electronics in this vehicle stink! The sensor wipers only work when it is not raining. The steering wheel touch controls only work sometimes. The air bags light comes on for weeks at a time, then just goes off. The low tire pressure light comes on, even if you completely empty the tires, fill them up correctly, and even overfill them. Also, the folding back seat is poorly designed. My other car is a Volvo xc70. The guys in Germany should buy a Volvo and study it. I got the Passat, because I thought it would be weird to have two of the same car. What a mistake. I should have gotten two Volvos. The price was about the same. I can't wait for the lease to end.;The car is fast and handles great. I wish it came without all the bells and whistles. ;volkswagen_passat
12/14/2006;TS;This is the first time I have bought a VW. I like the driving and handling of the new Passat 2.0T. The interior of the new Passat is laid out well and with the red/blue backlights the interior looks so nice at night. I am very happy with the gas mileage. With 200 hp, I average 24-27 mpg in mix driving (mostly city). The trip computer is awesome. If you're out for shopping for a compact to midsize SUV, you should look at the new Passat Wagon. It has a smooth drive, looks nice, has ample luggage space, and will save you money on gas.;The good gas mileage, nice interior and exterior style, trip compute, driving control, handling, acceleration, how it has lots of storage space, and the large trunk.;volkswagen_passat
12/02/2006;Les;The Passat 3.6 4Motion is an excellent car to drive. It has stylish looks. It's a great jump forward over the previous model. A job well done. ;;volkswagen_passat
12/02/2006;LSLBoiler;If you're looking to replace an SUV, this is the car for you. It gets great gas mileage (32-33 hwy/24-26 city), has lots of usable and easily-accessible cargo room, and has a very comfortable ride.;The Dynaudio stereo system, driver info system, and great engine performance.;volkswagen_passat
11/26/2006;Kimberly Willey;I bought this car thinking it would be an affordable reliable luxury sedan. The interior and exterior styling is something you would see in more expensive cars, for less. But what we have encountered is endless problems with the electronic systems and poor customer service from the manufacturers and dealers. The car has been in the shop three times for repairs in less then four months with so far nine days and counting loss of use. With this last incident, the car had to actually be towed to the dealership for service. If you want a reliable quality vehicle-keep shopping! ;Interior and exterior styling, amount of horsepower in the V6.;volkswagen_passat
11/20/2006;Imn2vws;I absolutely love my Passat. I have had no issues at all and enjoy every time I get to go for a ride. The 2.0T Turbo engine is very powerful for such a fuel efficient engine. 200hp and 32mpg. I would do it again in a heart beat....;"The engine, radio, Sport Edition seats, sport suspension, and Sport Edition 18"" wheels.";volkswagen_passat
11/16/2006;Jim;I have owned 45 cars in 45 years and over the last 10 years have driven only Mercedes, BMW's and Acuras. This is my first Volkswagen and I can't say that I am disappointed, it has been an adjustment to come from a BMW 330CI convertible to the Passat 3.6. I can say however, that I do enjoy the 280 HP engine and the Dynaudio sound system. The car is extremely quick off the line and easy to handle at high speeds. I have had to readjust to front wheel drive which is my only real complaint, the styling is beautiful and has a great European look. I do wish I had not made such a hasty decision and done a little more research before buying. I did get the entire premium/sport/navigation package.;"The Dynaudio sound, powerful engine, sport seats, navigation,18"" wheels, styling of the premium/sport package, great interior and trunk space, and safety. ";volkswagen_passat
11/15/2006;MN;I recently purchased a 2007 Passat Wagon 2.0T. This car replaced a 1999 Passat Wagon and is a significant upgrade over the previous models. The 2.0T engine has alleviated the lag that existed in the 1.8T that was standard in the 1999 version. In addition, the car has more leg room and storage which were lacking in the '99 model. This car is fun to drive and comfortable too when equipped with the luxury package. I also looked at the Volvo V70 but after test driving both, I decided the Passat was a better all around purchase. I hope the 2007 version will be as reliable as the 1999 we drove over 100,000 miles with only minor problems. ;The appearance, handling, and interior.;volkswagen_passat
11/14/2006;CDE;I am a first time VW buyer and so far I could not be any happier with my purchase. I got a 2006 pk1 for $22,300 and WOW this car is off the chain with performance. I have owned Honda's and Toyotas and they do not come close with anything vs. the Passat. ;The power, handling, and price.;volkswagen_passat
11/14/2006;Valleybull;Though I love the performance and comfort of my 2007 Passat 2.0T Wagon with 6-speed, Luxury, Leather, and Bi- xenons, I have had it for four months and I cannot wait to get rid of it. The build quality is the worst that I could imagine, from broken welds in the roof to creaks, squeaks, and rattles throughout the dash and headliner. I had read that VW's quality was a little shaky, but I was not prepared for this level of poor quality. I think that I would have been better off looking for a used 1984 Hyundai Pony, at least might expectations would have been in line with the results and the price.;The comfortable heated leather seats, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, nice stereo, and automatic dual zone climate control.;volkswagen_passat
11/11/2006;atr;"I have had the car for just over a week and loving every minute of it. I opted for the sport package and can't imagine it any other way. It has been quite a head-turner with lowered ride height and included 18"" rims. It handles like a dream with lot's of power. So far great it has been getting great gas mileage, 26 - 29 mpg. The manual transmission was a must for me and I couldn't be happier with it. It is a smooth shifter through all 6 gears and accelerates with ease.";The sport seats! They have a nice leather finish and are comfortable, with 12-way memory adjustments. I also love that the passenger's rear view mirror automatically adjusts to show the curb when the car is put in reverse. ;volkswagen_passat
11/09/2006;NY Passat;This vehicle has superb acceleration for a 4-cylinder. The engine feels much more powerful than the rated 200hp. The electric motor driven power steering allows for one finger steering at parking speeds and German style road feel at high speeds. Compared to a Volvo V70 2.5T you get most of the features, similar size, better performance and a $10,000 lower price.;The acceleration, performance, interior quality, lack of wind noise, and large versatile storage area.;volkswagen_passat
11/05/2006;Nuce;I was so excited to get the newly re-designed 2007 Passat Wagon! What a mistake! I have had this vehicle in the shop THREE times since I purchased it in March 2006. The Engine Malfunction lights keeps coming on and the dealership cannot find the problem, except to say that that there is an evaporator leak that they cannot fix it. The service manager also stated that they had several Passats that were doing this. Please don't think that the dealership will back you up on these problems;" THEY WON""T...I wrote a letter to VW and they were unwilling to help me too. Volkswagen will NOT stand behind their vehicle. The brakes squeak, too. Do not buy this vehicle.";volkswagen_passat
11/04/2006;Puzman;I must say, I am BLOWN AWAY by the new Passat. The gas mileage on our brand new vehicle is impressive;" over 28 mpg on my first commute (rural roads, interstate, city streets), and it should only get better. The power from the 2.0T motor is phenomenal, and shifts from the automatic are imperceptible. I thought I'd be using the Tiptronic a lot, but I can see myself just leaving it in ""D""- it's that good. I can't see why anyone would need the 3.6 unless they're hauling a trailer. The cabin is quiet and VERY comfortable - the leatherette is practically indistinguishable from the real thing. The Passat 2.0T is just the ticket for families that want performance, safety, and room without the thirst of an SUV. ";volkswagen_passat
11/03/2006;Mark B;"I have the 2007 Passat 2.0T with the sport suspension, sport seats and 18"" wheels. I absolutely love this car. The handling and ride is superb for a car with OE sport suspension. The interior has enough room for 5 big adults and the trunk is huge. I consistently average 33 mpg on the highway and around 30 mpg in the city.";"The 18"" wheels that come with the sport package, sport seats, and the Dynaudio radio system (make sure you get this).";volkswagen_passat
11/02/2006;Steven Myers;VW's '07 2.0T Passat Station wagon is a hoot. Powerful and agile, it longs for the Autobahn and no speed limit. It looks (and drives) like a much more expensive car. It comes loaded with standard features that might be money-making options and possesses a number of very avantgarde features, this Passat is worth a hard look/purchase. Even the low-end version comes replete with the safety, efficiency, comfort, and engineering features of a luxury vehicle. On the Interstate in MD I got 37 MPG on 87 fuel, with the air conditioning running. It is fast off the blocks with its Tiptronic transmission (with three modes: auto, sport, standard). I'm glad I bought mine - I'd buy a second Passat if I had a larger garage!;The interior design is comfortable and spacious. The powerful turbocharged 2 liter engine gets you out of trouble, yet sips fuel. This car is well assembled, there is not a squeak in the car. The attention to detail is pure Teutonic. This car is very safe, it has airbags everywhere, it has the best brakes I've ever had in a car, safety redundancies. The ride is great!;volkswagen_passat
10/30/2006;Stee;This is our second Passat Wagon, out first was a 2001 GLS 5-speed. We had many of the same complaints as have been voiced here about the options available on the 2.0T, but we got a call from the dealership telling us we could get all the options we wanted with the new configuration! So we did. We got bi xenon headlights, memory electric seats, Homelink, etc. We have had it for almost three months and 4,000 miles and we love it. My suggestion to other Passat lovers, tell the dealer what you want! This is a great car. Basically, we have got a Audi A4 in VW clothing (or maybe a BMW 5er)! Oh yeah, we are getting about 34 MPG highway and 25 in town..;We love the comfort features, like auto headlights/wipers, adaptive Bi xenon headlights, 12 Way Seats w/memory, Dynaudio, and the CD changer;volkswagen_passat
10/28/2006;Passat Fan;One cannot help but enjoy stepping into this car and feel its comfort and great handling. The design both interior and exterior is second to none, yet it is an affordable and economic vehicle. It is quite roomy and taking luggage with me is no longer a problem. I am also fascinated by all its features and one I particularly like is Auto hold. I like to think of this car this way, when the engineers designed it, they designed it for me. It gives me sheer driving pleasure. Hats off to Volkswagen! ;Auto hold, the new style ignition key, electronic parking brake, FSI turbo engine, lots of room, and lots of storage including the umbrella compartment.;volkswagen_passat
10/27/2006;eduright;"Well, I have test driven about 6 manuals and automatics. It is tricky to shift the manual, perhaps with several weeks practice it will get better/easier? I am not real happy with the clutch action. The ride is OK at lower speeds in town, but it's too noisy and a bit hard/rough at highway speeds on rough and bumpy pavement. It has good acceleration. The steering lacks fluidity. This car is not lithe, it handles OK for a biggish car. It has nice workmanship, looks, and an easy to use stereo with fair sound (but it's covered by road noise too easily). There was a good review of the Passat in Motor Trend's latest new car mag, which is out now. ""Excessive"" road/tire noise that covers stereo etc. is not good! This is a better car than most in its class though. ";The looks, acceleration, and roominess. It is good that VW and Audi, like Toyota, is working on making less toxic car interiors. I can tell it has less of that toxic and dangerous new car smell. It gets fairly good gas mileage. I believe that 27-28 mpg is possible in mixed driving.;volkswagen_passat
10/25/2006;new vw;I purchased a new VW Passat 3.6 4Motion Wagon about a month ago. It is a really good looking vehicle and a blast to drive. It has lots of power, a smooth delivery, is very comfortable, and its gas mileage is very reasonable for such a powerful vehicle. The brakes are excellent and I really like the turning Xenon lights, which point in the direction the car is turning at intermediate speeds. The interior is of the highest quality, luxurious, well fitting, and ergonomic. The Dynaudio stereo system provides excellent sound. The space in the rear seat is good, even for adults. I am delighted to have chosen this vehicle and enjoy driving it every day.;Lots of power, excellent brakes, very comfortable seats, use the seat memory feature when parking in a valet garage, lots of features one would expect from more upscale vehicles, plenty of space, and very good handling.;volkswagen_passat
10/07/2006;Michael Farrell;I just completed a 600 mi. round trip to Crested Butte from Albuquerque in the new family wagon, including interstates, mountain passes, 2 lane roads, muddy dirt roads and even a few inches of snow. The '07 Passat Wagon was an all around pleasure for either driver or passenger. The ride is very comfortable, handling excellent with plenty of power (for me) on acceleration and the highways and hills. Excellent gas mileage as well;" nearly 33 mpg highway. I opted for package #2, 17"" wheels and Dynaudio. Wow -- the Dynaudio is well worth the $$$! After 6 months of ownership I have neglible complaints about the vehicle. A little higher sticker, but a fine step up from our '05 Passat Sedan. ";volkswagen_passat
09/30/2006;Joylin;When driving the 2007 Passat, you feel like you are driving a BMW, Audi or Mercedes without a huge debt. I love the inside. this car has a lot of power for a 2 liter engine and it is very good on gas. It has a lot of details, specially inside. I have never had any problem with it at all. It is an excellent choice for a long term car.:-);The interior design and excellent reliability.;volkswagen_passat
09/27/2006;Justin;I replaced my 1999 Honda Civic EX with this Passat. It has a beautiful blue finish. This car hauls compared to my Civic. I know VW has had reliability issues in the past and sludge problems with certain engines. This model is made in Germany and not in Mexico or Brazil so I am more confident that this car is made to last. We will see, so far this vehicle is a dream. I love driving in it!;The paint, the auto hold feature, electronic parking brake, 2.0 Turbo engine, 6-speed manual transmission, and sunroof. All around this car kicks butt!;volkswagen_passat
09/17/2006;ilmnc;All my life I have owned American made cars. Then came time for a new car and we decided to go with a Passat for more room. The car can fit two full size children car seats and a booster in it easily and it is good on gas. I have never had so much fun driving a car before this one. Not even the new Ford Mustang was this much fun. I now find excuses to drive the Passat. It handles like a dream and is very responsive to my style of driving. It has a smooth and quite ride and an outstanding sound system. The standard safety features with the addition of the rear side airbags add a sense of security. You feel totally protected from whatever could go wrong during your drive. I love this car.;The sunroof, stereo, control display on the instrument panel, adjustable settings for the heated seats, how all five seats have 3-point seatbelts, the new adjustable arm-rest (unlike the one in the 2006), and the standard safety features. ;volkswagen_passat
08/30/2006;ewolfers;After owning a 2004 Passat Wagon I was surprised to find some of the downgrades in the updated version. The dashboard materials screem General Motors-like, not-quasi luxury Euro car. The door pulls are hard plastic instead of kind of rubbery like before. The front seats are flat as pancakes offering no thigh support, so much for that five hour road trip. There's also no lateral support in the front seats. The seats and the long straight dash remind me more of a Buick than a VW. The new dash is very far away and high up making forward visibility poor.;"They did fix the HVAC by putting in knobs and not changing the fan speed automatically with the ""AUTO"" button in the off possition. This is a decently fun car to drive.";volkswagen_passat
08/29/2006;Alexander;"The first thing that impresed me was the engine - it is small but quite powerful. One just has to push the accelerator pedal down to get most out of it. The acceleration is especially impressive with the gear in the sport mode - even from a zero start. I love the exterior design. Tthe same goes for the interior, with some reservation for the front seat ergonomics - they are comfortable but could be a bit more accomodating. To add a ""fly to the ointment"" - I already had to get the sensor switch in the passenger seat safety belt buckle replaced. The dealership experience has been very good so far. ";The engine, brakes, and cruise control.;volkswagen_passat
08/14/2006;Robert;I was very pleased with the Passat at first. That is until I found a small dent upon delivery, it broke down due to a loose ground strap, the Dynaudio stereo has a problem with losing the lower bass, a constant morris-code rattle at the driver' side pillar, the hesitive fuel peddle response, and of course the poor service from every dealer I've been to. They never seem to be able to fix anything right the first time. I'm going to sell this waste of money the first chance I get. That is unless VW and their sorry excuse for mechanics can fix these tivial issues. ;The good leg room and how quiet it is when it breaks down.;volkswagen_passat
07/29/2006;Chris;The 2007 Passat Wagon replaced my V8 Touareg. The wagon offers more space and utility than my Touareg did, while providing a much better driving experience. I'm averaging 29 mpg combined and about 34 mph hwy...roughly double what I got in the Touareg. This also turns heads more than the Touareg did new. Any stigma my wife thought she'd feel with a wagon is absolutely gone. She loves the style and realizes it's a smarter purchase than another SUV would've been. This is an Audi / Mercedes / BMW quality vehicle at a Chevy price.;By far the 2.0T engine. It has torque all over the place while it gets 30 mpg. This vehicle's handling is incredible, it feels like I'm driving a compact car. We love the way the DVD Navigation system dresses up the interior. It makes it feel like a $60,000 car. The trunk is huge and the power lifting gate is incredibly handy. ;volkswagen_passat
07/13/2006;Sam;You won't find a better car at this price. I leased a 2003 base Passat Wagon and liked that too. This time I went for the leather package. I have nothing to complain about so far. It is stylish enough for a night outing. It has good handling and decent fuel economy. Its cargo space is so spacious that you don't need an SUV. ;;volkswagen_passat
07/07/2006;SeattleBob;I've had my 2007 Passat 2.0T for almost a month. I'm averaging 29.6 mpg. This car replaced my unreliable 2003 Land Rover Discovery. My heart wanted a sporty convertible. My head wanted a good mileage and plenty of cargo space. This car does it all. It is a joy to drive and it has plenty of space for 4+ people and cargo. It has a solid feel, very comfortable, and superior fit and finsh. It has plenty of bells and whistles to compete with luxury cars twice the price. The large sunroof fills the desire for feeling the sun and wind. This car should be on your short list if you are seeking a sporty, roomy, fuel efficient car under $30,000.;The fit and finish that VW is famous for, great handling, good gas mileage, and spacious interior.;volkswagen_passat
06/17/2006;jnwfla;My wife bought this car to replace a 2003 Buick Rendezvous. She is thriled. She gets the space she needed and the zip she did not have. And, the car looks great. She loves all the features, but the XM radio is on the top of her list (go figure). Now she can listen to even more sports talk radio....what a girl (and, her in it, makes the car look even sexier than it already is). Anyone looking at SUV's should consider this car.;XM radio, push button key, power liftgate, turbo power, lots of storage space, sunroof, ride and looks great.;volkswagen_passat
06/05/2006;gjk;"In the approximately 3 weeks we have had the black on black wagon we have been stopped repeatedly by people asking what type of car is it, what year is it, is it a BMW, etc. We had 2002 Audi A6 wagon for the last four years and did not give anything up by getting this car except for saving a bunch of money. Its fit and finish are top notch, its engine excellent, its stlying is sharp, and its ride is fun. Get the sport package for no other reason than the sport seats which are much better than the ""comfort"" seats. Also it has metal on dash instead of wood for a little more sporty appearance. This car is loaded with features and technology. We also looked at BMW 325xi and Subaru Outback but this was by for the best for the money. We have had no problems to date. ";The engine, power liftgate, room, looks, active xenon headlights...its really a complete package.;volkswagen_passat
06/01/2006;Steve Myers;"The Passat looks like a Mercedes competitor at a fraction of the cost. VW has done it again, with a Sport Wagon that feels larger inside than it is on the outside. This Teuton has classy looks, a kick-butt blower engine, comfort, style, and a TON of ""standard options,"" for a darned good price. There are unobtrusive storage compartments everywhere. The keyless key-ignition, a no-lever emergency brake, and a hill- hugger extra clutch add to the attractiveness of this car. It even has a driver-controlled data management system that will translate programmed orders into seven languages (incl. Chinese). Take one out for a spin and you'll never buy another Taurus wagon or a minivan.";The triptronic 6-speed automatic transmission, data management module in dash, ease of maneuvering, pep, programmable alarm, HUGE interior, and attention to detail everywhere.;volkswagen_passat
05/31/2006;sc;The Passat's size is excellent. One problem is the low windows and size, create a blind area on the driver's side for oncoming cars. You need to crain your neck 'round to make sure there isn't a vehicle in the lane immediately on your left. Otherwise this is a fun car.;;volkswagen_passat
05/30/2006;V Dubagon;I am new to the wagon, however we also own a 2006 Passat Value Edition. We love them both. They are always fun and stylish. This car definitley stands out over the Accords or Camrys. You couldn't ask for a better vehicle. It has oodles of room, lots of power for this size of vehicle vs. engine. VW has done it again. What a great car company. ;Navigation, Sirius radio, Dynaudio and for the little one...rear airbags. ;volkswagen_passat
05/24/2006;rainer;I have had this car now for almost a month. I have driven 2,675 miles. I It handles like a charm. There is no excess lean in corners. In rain or shine it sticks to the road like it is on rails. I am waiting for the winter and snow. My fuel mileage so far has been 22 mpg - city, 31.5 mpg - highway, avg. 27.2. I am using the Triptronic when I first start the car and drive in that mode it gives me better gas mileage. After the car has warmed up, I switch to standard auto. I also use Tiptronic in the city for the same reason.;It has the best steering system that I ever had. It is very responsive and direct at any speed. I just love the handling of the car. Its controls are easy to use and its seats are extremly comfortable, better than in my old 2004 240C Benz, and it has lots of room.;volkswagen_passat
05/12/2006;justin h;Regardless of which VW you drive the suspension build is much greater than most car brands. There is no play in the steering wheel, no sway around corners, and plenty of power now that the 2.0 4 banger is gone as a base engine. After renting Pontiac's and Fords, and driving many other brands, driving a VW is how driving should feel.;;volkswagen_passat
05/04/2006;VW2007;Driving so far (2 months) has been great. My gas mileage on a 420 mile trip was 31.4 mpg. The only thing missing is Homelink controls for garage doors.;Comfort of seating, both front and back;volkswagen_passat
04/29/2006;jake;Currently I am braking in the car. It only has 235 miles. The gas mileage is 22-27 city, in mixed highway and freeway driving on regular unleaded gas. My dealer told me that you do not have to use super. I think that after the car is broken in, that the gas mileage will go up. I took the car out in the rain today and it handled great it was a pleasure to drive. The electronic assisted steering and the 4Matic are just great. That's about it for now will advise more later.;The steering,4Matic, Triptronic transmission, and power to spare.;volkswagen_passat
03/23/2006;Gary in CA;I was shopping for small to medium SUV to replace my BMW convertible. This 2007 Passat Wagon supplies the fun-to-drive factor that I craved, with the cargo area that I needed, in a well-fitted, comfortable, full-featured package...and it kept me under my $30,000 ceiling. I'm also delighted with the 23/31 gas mileage. As a bonus, my fashion-conscious fiancee will allow herself to be seen in and to drive my new Passat Wagon. This vehicle gets lots of style points.;I like the balanced handling, the space-age ignition key and the easy access to all the controls. The auto opening & closing of the rear cargo door is also very cool. Lots of neat storage places, too.;volkswagen_passat
03/21/2006;Wisconsin Driver; So far we have had this car for about 4 months. My wife absolutely loves her car, she feels it is easy to drive and the most comfortable we have ever owned. I like the sporty feel (when she lets me drive it), and it never lacks for power. If you are looking for a new family car check out the new Passat, you will not be disappointed.;Heated leather seats, fantastic dynaudio sound system, plenty of room for our family of 5.

05/30/2009;lfouts;I have 20,000 miles on my 07 Passat 2.0T. Last week it quit operating while on the freeway. Felt like it was out of gas and unresponsive to gas pedal. Had plenty of gas. Coasted to shoulder and it resumed operating. Then there was a loud noise that was not from the engine. Towed it to the dealer. They checked it out and found nothing wrong. It drove perfectly again. The technician gently told me that perhaps I hit the brake and the gas at the same time and the computer, for safety, favored the brake and went into a low power mode. Sounded possible the way tech explained it. I don't trust the car now. Anyone else had this problem?;Drives great, solid feel, good gas mileage. ;volkswagen_passat
04/10/2009;Randy;I test drove Audis and BMWs before deciding on the Passat. I love the six speed transmission, and using the Sport setting makes the car go like a rocket. Insurance is very reasonable on this model too. Absolutely no problems in two years of ownership, which is something even my Honda couldn't deliver (I don't know why Consumer Reports keeps knocking VW quality, when I've owned 3 VWs and had few problems). The power and performance of this car is great, and it's comfortable on long trips. If I had it to do over, I would have paid for the leather package because I plan to keep this car for a long time.;Love the power, when passing and when cruising along. I live in the South and the climate control system keeps the car nice and cool.;volkswagen_passat
03/27/2009;Ardis;The 2.0T is fun to drive but the automatic tranny is slow on take off and lacks throttle response. There are a couple of aggravating squeaks in the interior on rough roads but overall interior is very nice quality, just needs some tweaking. The tail lights are separating within the light fixture and resting on the inner part of the enclosure plastic. To fix, u must replacing the entire fixture. Lights look good but are poorly put together. AC is cold but fan is insufficient to blow/cool even the front of the car in adequate time. One final note is that the car is fun to drive and the turbo, once spun up, is very responsive. Every car has its shortcomings and vw is no exception. ;Pleasantly responsive at highway speeds and gas mileage will be hard to beat. ;volkswagen_passat

This car we've owned for almost 2 years and have gotten great gas mileage and excellent reliability from our Passat. I don't like the car but for the price and features, size, comfort, suspension we can't beat the German price we got. Other owners have complained but how do they really treat their cars? Do they really service them when needed, Volkswagen has really come up from where they were a couple years ago. Back in 2000 I bought a brand new Beetle and the thing within a year broke down 6 times less than 10k miles, I'm impressed with the improvement of quality.;Suspension and smooth drive, great gas mileage.;volkswagen_passat

Mileage since new 27.1. Highway 32.0 (at 70+ mph). Using low-octane regular fuel. Only complaint is dumb cupholder design. My wife doesn't like the looks, but we both love the practicality. I will buy this one when lease ends.;Practical, reliable, great mileage.;volkswagen_passat
12/04/2008;13HUNDY;"At just over 30k miles, I would have to say that this is a pretty good car. Other than regular maintenance (which is more expensive than I anticipated), I've had it in the dealership to update the ECU once. The build seems solid, and that turbo makes it a blast to drive with good gas mileage to boot. Handling is good, not tight, but not sloppy either. The interior seems very refined, I don't have all the rattles that I've experienced with other cars. I didn't care for the stock radio, so installed my own. There's so many ""little"" features about this car that I just love. I hope it lasts quite awhile.";4cyl Turbo. Good gas mileage. Many safety features. Cheap to insure.

Absolute money pit. ;;volkswagen_passat
11/16/2008;07Passat;This car has performed very well for me in the past year and a half. I average about 31 mpg on the highway and 26 mpg during mixed driving. There isn't another 4-cylinder in this price range that performs as well. VW recommends premium fuel, but I haven't had any problems running regular, midgrade, or premium. Also, oil changes are expensive due to synthetic oil requirement. I hope the car remains reliable over the years, as some studies show that VW's can have reliability issues.;Engine - good start up speed. Seats - drove from WI to WA (2000 mi) in 2.5 days and didn't have a sore butt. In my Grand Am, the seat starting becoming sore after about 300 miles.

We needed more utility, so we decided to purchase a Passat Wagon. This car is great. Loads of space, fold flat rear seats, automatic real lift gate, heated seats, sunroof....great audio system. What can I say, the same great ride and handling, good performance of the sedan...with a ton of utility space. The kicker...we are averaging 28.6 mpg over the last 5k miles. This wagon is getting better gas mileage that our 2006 Sedan....same engine, same transmission....maybe we're just driving it better, or maybe it's just a great wagon.;volkswagen_passat

We've had the entire A/C system replaced (that was fun, going up a hill, a grinding sound and tons of smoke and the car died), many belts have broken, various sensors have malfunctioned, electrical problems and I could go on.

10/10/2008;harmsaj;Fun car, has plenty of kick when you punch it, not my GTO, but hey. This is the first turbo car and VW that I've voluntarily bought, and it was worth it. We just drove back from the mother- in-law's, 489 miles. There was still over a quarter tank of gas left, that rocks! Couple design features I'm not crazy about, but later, fun car, great utility, kind of a rough ride for a larger car, but moves like a smaller car. Suspension is kind of mushy, no slaloms anytime soon. Sounds sweet with an aftermarket intake!!! ;The kick, this thing will chirp the tires through 2nd and 3rd. Lots of space, full size spare, and killer gas mileage.;volkswagen_passat
08/24/2008;John;This is the best driving car and most fun car to drive I have ever owned. Previous cars were Toyota, Ford vehicles. This blows them away. Great brakes and the ride is comfortable.

06/21/2008;passatlove;I bought my Passat used, 2007 model in 2008 and absolutely love it! It came with the sport package which really sets the car off with the 18? wheels/tires and lowered suspension. When I was shopping for a car in 2007, I settled for a Jetta Wolfsburg edition because of my finances at the time and could not afford the Passat I really wanted. A year after I bought my Jetta I saw the Passat 3.6 w/sport package on the used lot of my local VW dealership. After talking with the sales manager I finally got a price I could afford. When my coworkers ride in my car they tell me that they really like how the interior is laid out and how the car rides and the exterior looks.;Dual power 12 way seats, climatronic, sport package, auto wipers, memory drivers seat/ext mirrors, dynaudio and the list goes on and on. Pretty much everything.;volkswagen_passat
06/19/2008;John;I came to the Passat from an A4 which was too small. The potential competitors were either too expensive etc. I think of the Passat as an A6 with a $15,000 rebate. No problems so far but I am concerned with the oil pump bolt that is a recognized failure item. I routinely get 28+mpg on highway at speeds that almost never get over 100. The acceleration from 65 or 70 to way too fast is right now with no drama. So far one of the better cars I have owned. The VAG reputation for for lack of long term reliability is a concern which is why it will be gone before the warranty is. From what I understand the Passat wagon is being killed off. If true, that is too bad.;Handles well for what it is. Engine is superb. Interior very nice.;volkswagen_passat
06/14/2008;radiogeek;"My 7th Passat, and 3rd of this ""B6"" series. I've had NO reliability issues with any.

I paid just over $24,800--some $3K off sticker. You can't get this much European car for the money anywhere else. Make no mistake--unlike the Audi A4, this is NOT a sports sedan.

05/13/2008;bikerbob;Me and my wife chose the Passat over the Accord and Camry for value, comfort safety and performance.

04/26/2008;Orion Cavins;I traded my 03 Honda Accord for the Passat. Love the car except the premium fuel requirement. Recently oil pressure light comes on in between oil change (10,000 miles between as recommended by manual). Had car towed to dealership. They said car can consume 1 qt for every 1200 miles, and Volkswagen considers that normal? This sounds like a design flaw to me. My accord went 10,000 miles between changes and never lost a drop. I had it well into the 80K area. I am not satisfied with their response to this so far. I didn't win this car in a raffle, and want it to last without worry. Other problems is radio had display glitch and air bag on drivers side had to be replaced. Not happy at this time;I love the acceleration in the mid range. Very smooth.

I've also had trouble with the Bluetooth (installed by the dealer after-market), and the Nav system had to be replaced after it got ""stuck."" Except for the purchase experience, I have had nothing but customer service trouble with two local dealerships (not the one I purchased it from) and VW Corporate.

Seems to be electrical and sensors not working or going bad. I get about 31-32 MPG Highway and 25 City. Not bad for a 200 HP Car that performs like a V8 Mustang.

04/11/2008;Chris;I bought this sedan after having a tree fell on top my week-old Passat Wagon. This car is super plush, super quick, and has every amenity I could possibly want. I actually chose this over a more expensive Mercedes C-class sport, which I found extremely sluggish and a lot smaller. For me, the Passat is like getting the Audi A4 engine with the A6 room...and saving about $20,000. One problem, though: the brakes are god-awful. They are spongy and way too small for the engine, which is extremely peppy--especially when accelerating between in the mid range. Going up hills, and accelerating at highway speed, the 2.0 turbo really hums. Love the stereo too.;good looking, quick engine, roomy;volkswagen_passat
04/10/2008;AudiGuy18T;I traded from a 2001 Audi A4 1.8T with Quattro. This Passat beats the Audi out in every way. Tornado red with tan leather!

Since I've owned it over 1 year and 21,000 miles, ive had to replace the low note horn and an oxygen sensor. The dealership is not the greatest, but there are plenty of places to go for service. I love this car, I get many compliments everywhere I go from people who are 18 to 70! It's a real head turner.

04/09/2008;KCjayhawk;Purchased the 07' Passat wagon used in March with less than 10K miles and so far it is a real joy to drive. I too like many am experiencing some unpleasant squeaking in the dash area, but my local dealer assures me it can be fixed. Traded in a 4Runner and I have about the same amount of cargo space, it's actually longer than my wife's Grand Cherokee. If you are tired of getting beat up driving an SUV, this is a great alternative. Engine, while a little clunky sounding on the outside, is very smooth and responsive. The interior is gracefully simplistic with all of the controls intuitively placed.

04/04/2008;Serg;I purchased this car a year ago. First, I was very satisfied. This car looks and performs well for the money I paid. Since the purchase, I?ve been in the service at least 8 times; mostly minor things like lights and radio, but I also had a bigger concern: the oil level goes from max to min in 3K miles. At dealership, they changed some parts including turbo. Still, the problem was not resolved. It took me a year back and forth. Year later, they took a test after 645 miles and determine that 200 grams of oil are gone. They call to VW and after that called me and said that VW says that it is normal. I thought they were joking. They were not. ;volkswagen_passat

They were fun to look at and knew how to have a good conversation, but the maintenance was crazy. Two hours to put on make-up, lots of shopping and were always a little too picky about what they ate.

Now at 23000 miles later, it is recurring. Also car idles loud like it was a diesel. They said it was the oil pump and replaced it. I?m wondering now if my car had proper lubrication. From time to time when turning my signals off, the opposite side goes on (confusing for the person behind me). Also the light came on the dash saying tires were low so I put the proper air required but the light would not go off. I found out the spare tire in the trunk was setting the low tire pressure signal off. Now go figure! Besides that ride is smooth, gas is ok.;The turbo is awesome.;volkswagen_passat
06/18/2007;VWtony;I purchased my 07 Passat in early November. I just got it out of the shop after they had it for 9 days. A check engine light came on during a road trip in the middle of nowhere. Not fun. Turns out the oil cooler bolt and bracket broke, so it and the timing assembly had to be changed. The car had less than 9k miles on it. Now, one week after having the car returned to me, it's in the shop again because the steering lock is malfunctioning. This is my 3rd VW and all of them have had major issues. ;It's fast, comfortable and gets decent gas mileage. ;volkswagen_passat
06/14/2007;bostonaudi;"So far it's been a good family cruiser, with lots of power. The sport suspension is a good setup. Couple of annoyances, I am 6'5"", and find that the vertical height of the windshield is a bit low. I used to have 2001 Passat, with its higher windshield I found that outward visibility was better. The 07 Passat's windshield is raked further, which reduces the vertical height. Another issue is the transmission. Mine has a fairly bad hesitation as slow speed (< 10mph), it doesn't always want to go back to 1st gear. Overall the 3.6 motor is quite the little monster, great acceleration! I chipped mine with Revo which gets another 20hp. Recommended!";Rear built in sunscreens are a nice touch. Really like having nav. Big 3.6 motor, great sounds. Sport suspension recommended, sport also comes with nice seats.;volkswagen_passat
06/01/2007;Dan R.;Second Passat, previous one was a 2000. This car is head and shoulders better, with improved styling, performance, and safety features. I love it! Can't beat the price for a near-luxury European sedan.;Fuel economy, engine power, handling, styling, price/value.;volkswagen_passat
05/30/2007;Jaime;I LOVE my new car! This is my second Volkswagon. My first, 2001 Cabrio, was not great whatsoever. I was a little bit iffy on getting another Volkswagen but I'm glad I did. It's been great!;I find myself not having to fill up on gas a lot so thats a plus! Also I love the looks of the outside and the inside and it drives terrific!;volkswagen_passat
05/30/2007;Halavais;This is my second new VW, and I am very happy with it. I was considering a number of other cars (the TL, a Lexus, an A4, and a BMW), but this one was easily the best, especially if you, like me, want a little bit of extra room. It's gotten a lot of compliments in terms of looks, but really it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Fun to just drop the hammer sometimes. As an aside, I drive mostly on highways, and at, um, excessive speeds :) and my mileage is a bit above the 26 MPG listed here.;I ended up with the sport edition, with lots of the bells and whistles. I don't think there is a single favorite feature, but it all comes together nicely. The car just works.;volkswagen_passat
05/30/2007;Fun-N-Groovin;Love this car so far. We traded out of an 03 BMW 5 series and feel like we upgraded. The ride is quiet and comfortable, the engine is responsive on the highway, the back seat is roomier than what we had, especially legroom. The free Sirius satellite radio is a plus as well. Overall, we feel like we got a sweet ride for a lot less than what we could have spent on an equivalently equipped Audi or BMW. We purchased the mocha with tan interior and it is a great combo.;Quiet ride, highway speed change, roominess, the baggy latch in the trunk to hold your grocery bag in place.;volkswagen_passat
05/28/2007;Vlade Divac;There are too many things to love about the car, so I'll only list the cons: The navi takes getting used to, and for $1,800, there are PLENTY of things missing: 1) voice-recognition, 2) touchscreen capability, and 3) you can't play CDs while using the nav. The iPod: it's great having the dock connector and an aux input, but the display doesn't include artist/song/album info. Ridiculous! Also, the aux input should be in the armrest, not next to the dock in the glovebox. The Dynaudio is crystal clear even at high volumes, but needs more bass. My Sirius capability didn't work and had to return for servicing immediately after I got it. Bummer. There's a button for it but no Bluetooth!;"Sport package is the ONLY way to go on the Passat. Beautiful 18"" rims, lowered suspension, sexy seats, etc. Features galore for a non-luxury car. I don't need to repeat what's already been repeatedly said, but I'll do it again: this is easily on par with Acuras, BMWs, Lexuses & the rest!";volkswagen_passat
05/26/2007;malter;Have owned the car for 2 weeks so far I am impressed. Gas mileage is great. The performance of the engine is very impressive . The transmission and clutch operate like butter (the best FWD manual I ever drove). The handling of the car is a little strange at hi-way speeds, on lane changes with the DSC on, the frt. end bobs and sways a little.With the DSC disengaged (off) the car is neutral and reacts normally, strange for a safety feature. My MFD display has started to fade in warm weather the dealer has ordered parts, hopefully this is a one time occurence. ;Clutch/transmission, interior room, MPG, build quality.;volkswagen_passat
05/20/2007;YyysAzz;I owned a 99 Passat that I got from a co-worker that was about to retire, it had 210,000 miles I had driven the car for almost a year and needed a new car. Went looking and the Passat was high on the list. As soon as I saw the Wolfsburg edition I was sold. Almost everything you would want: MP3 CD changer, heated seats, steering wheel controls, fog lights; I saw it on a Saturday and drove out Monday afternoon. I have leased 4 GM SUVs in the last 10 years and I am more excited about this car than all of them. If you are in the market for a great car this is the one you want, but hurry only 6000 Wolfsburgs, if you miss one, wait if you can - a 50 state legal TDI is coming out in the fall. ;volkswagen_passat
05/19/2007;North VW;Good car overall. Lots of pep and comfortable for a 6 å? foot tall male over 230 lbs. Have radio with satellite XM, however with this configuration iPod not offered. Big bummer at a sticker price of over $40K and still can not hook up the iPod. Squeaky front breaks and a new noise from the front end (constant squeaking from the front end when you hard over to the right, up a small incline. Having it checked on now. Slight plastic-on-plastic vibration noise in the steering column. Overall a very cool car to drive and has all that my past BMW and Audi had (and more). Convenience items abound. ;Engine pep and convenience items (power everything) as well as ride.;volkswagen_passat
05/15/2007;Chance the Gardener;I didn't have much expectations when I leased this car. I just wanted a nice car for a good price. This car exceeded my expectations a thousand fold. Every time I drive it I find something else to like about it.;Engine power, Triptronic trans, suspension. And talk about storage, there are so many places to store things.;volkswagen_passat
05/11/2007;pbilunos;So far, a great car. Comfortable, quick and fun to drive. Great to drive and room for OZ (the dog). We love it.;Ride, comfort and features, room - about the same as our previous SUV but a much better ride and more comfortable.;volkswagen_passat
05/08/2007;Guenter;I've driven the car now for 7 months and put on almost 20000 miles, 80% on interstate and highway. I like the responsiveness of the engine and the great traction, especially in snow. Gas mileage has been much better than expected from such a powerful engine. On the interstate I usually get 26-28 mpg, on the highway 27-32, in town about 20-24. Up to now I have not encountered any problems. I can recommend this car to anybody who has to drive a lot, wants to have some fun while driving and still occasionally has to haul a family.;Excellent traction and fun to drive. Good gas mileage. Powerful acceleration, super for passing on 2 lane highways. The Tiptronic shifts after I got used to it. ;volkswagen_passat
05/05/2007;N1128Q;I have had this car for one week - it is the 2nd Passat I've leased and I'm impressed with it so far. Smooth ride, great handling, fit and finish seem excellent, quiet ride. The Wolfsburg Edition has a lot of content for the price. While the Japanese cars give you a lot of bells and whistles for a few dollars less, the VW is more of a driver's car. I'll trade gee-gaws for real performance everytime.;Interior fit/finish, turbo motor (goes like heck and doesn't use much gas), handling, brakes, and all of the safety features.;volkswagen_passat
10/19/2009;NewBeetleDriver;I adore my New Beetle. Even though I'm a male, I get compliments from my other guy friends, especially after they've driven it. Convertible a must! The only problem I've had was the wiring harness shorted. Fortunately, the car is still under warranty, and will be back to running soon!;Transmission, styling/aesthetics, comfort, heritage;volkswagen_new_beetle
10/11/2009;cfr5555;I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since. Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring.;Engine, exterior design, front seat(s) comfort.;volkswagen_new_beetle
08/15/2009;nlinldsey;This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car! I recently sold mine since my family needs space. The car is very sturdy and well-built. I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate. I also loved the space once the back seat folds down. It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage. I never experienced mechanical problems with it. My only complaint was the oil change would cost me $70 or more. This car requires Synthetic oil, which is more expensive than regular oil. ;The sound system is excellent - the Monsoon System! I also love the gas mileage! I found the seats very comfortable. I owned a Honda Accord once and would often have back aches from the longer rides. However, this did not happen in the Beetle.;volkswagen_new_beetle
07/22/2009;Bug Luver;"Love my Bug I get so many compliments on my car. It is so much fun to drive and my husband who is 6' 2"" has plenty of room and is comfortable, it is my favorite car, the only improvement would be mpg, other than that the best car I have ever owned";fun colors;volkswagen_new_beetle
02/15/2009;Kshobe;"I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back. I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis. I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3"" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive. ";Engine performance and gas mileage. I think the MPG improves the faster you drive.;volkswagen_new_beetle
01/01/2009;Kayemtee;My wife chose this car to replace a Sebring convertible. Wanted a clutch again before we got too old. Performance is adequate at best; acceleration reminds me of my old bugs of my youth. Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars. Great head and leg room (I'm six-two). Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring). Heated seats (with five settings) are great! Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration. Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car. Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter. Trunk holds a lot but small opening. I like the car but glad we lease.;volkswagen_new_beetle
08/02/2008;jik;4 of us carpool 1 way 30 min. Backseat ok for normal size. Gas mileage could be better but luv, luv my dream car. Someone is always commenting about it as I did for many years b4 I bought it. Coworkers are happy I finally bought it because they were probably tired of me talking about it for about 5 yrs. I don't have a garage, unfortunately, but it is great in the snow. Haven't had any problems to date. Love to go riding on beautiful days with the top down.;Riding with the top down on a beautiful day. When it's a little cool, being able to put the heated seats on. Luv it! ;volkswagen_new_beetle
05/16/2008;Ray Cavanagh;I owned a 2002 SLK and 2003 BMW Z-4. After spending a fortune for upkeep of these two cars I dumped them both and bought a 2007 Convertible, and a 2008 Triple White coupe. They both run circles around my former car. I have homes in both Sacramento and Palm Springs, a ride of 500 miles. Both cars get me there in style and comfort. So far, I have been happy with both. The comfort level and handling has been outstanding. Love the fact that I am putting regular gas in and not the premium I was so use to. I will never do the luxury car route again when I can get a better car in the New Bug.;Love it all, style and seats.;volkswagen_new_beetle
05/14/2008;Phil;Love the Laser Blue color.!! This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 - 4 cylinder engine. Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city. The heated seats are the best new feature.! I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well. The comfort is great, and the room is great. I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car. My only other request is to make this car a hybrid. I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control. I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards, so this car is FAST.! Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle.!;Heated seats, folding down back seat, sunroof/moonroof.;volkswagen_new_beetle
03/28/2008;harvestmoon;Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!;heated seats, color, body style, driver and front passenger space.;volkswagen_new_beetle
02/22/2008;S.Horton;I have owned by Beetle for 7 months and have had no problems. I love this car. At first the look impressed me the most. I finally found a 5-speed, green model which was hard to come by. The way this car handles is great. It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car. The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning! It handles in 6 inches of snow, no problem, and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better! If you are looking for a fun car with a low-maintenance feel and features then this is the car for you! ;Body style: people will stop you on the street to ask about the car! Interior features: ample space, stereo sound, heated seats, dash style, trunk space is great. ;volkswagen_new_beetle
01/03/2008;The Husband;The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather. It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler. It really makes my wife happy and I like that. The problem is that the windows have to open (when the handle is pulled) to open the door. If it gets below 20 degrees, the windows won't open. That means that you can't get in, and if you finally do, you can't close the door or the glass will break. Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one.;Doors open and close in warm weather. Wife isn't angry about the car in summer. No paying for additional garage space or storage spring through fall. I do love how it looks and operates when the windows are not frozen.;volkswagen_new_beetle
10/05/2007;Bug Lover;I finally got my dream car: the VW Beetle. Mine is a 2007. I am in love! It is very cute, and I love to drive it. No problems yet; I am keeping my fingers crossed. Would and do recommend to friends.;volkswagen_new_beetle
09/27/2007;Kristina;I love my car. I previously owned an Explorer, and the two are difficult to compare. The only thing I miss about my Explorer is the storage space, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much can fit in a Beetle. I don't understand why people complain about the gas mileage, I think it's great but then my Explorer did have a V8 engine. Beetles are fun cars to drive, the sound system is great, and it works perfectly as a commuter car.;The convertible top. The seat material. Comfort of the arm rest. How easy it is to reach the instruments and radio. The head rest that bends forward. The safety rating.;volkswagen_new_beetle
08/15/2007;Don&#039;t get excited;A car is supposed to be a reliable transportartion and reliable it is not. Too many trips to the service department, too many recalls, too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems. I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in. I'm charged an arm and a leg every time, without a guarantee that the fix will work. A 10 year old KIA has had no problems. I got too excited about aesthetics of it. But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed. If only I read more reviews of long-term owners. Never another VW again. They are nice when on the dealer lot, but in reality too much trouble.;volkswagen_new_beetle

07/28/2007;Rwikerson;This is my first foreign car and now I get it. This car is quite impressive all around. I love this car. It is comfortable, enjoyable, affordable, even if the gas mileage isn't stellar. It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city. You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle. It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car. Don't over think and criticize the back seat. It is more than enough. So the head room isn't excessive, I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad. Enjoy the ride.;Everything. The seats' adjustability, the interior room, the strong driving position, ease of driving, gas mileage, quick throttle response, 5 cylinder torque and horsepower on demand at lower RPMs, fold down seats with removable seat head rests, fits in the garage.

07/17/2007;cathiem;I have had the Beetle convertible for about 1 year (not driving it in the winter months). I totally love it. It is fun, reliable and has enough pep for me. I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk, as I expected virtually nothing. Just really really pleased.

06/24/2007;susanne;Having owned another Beetle and a Jetta before this, I have come to realize that VWs on average have a shelf life of about 4 years, then it's time to trade it in! Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner, I keep coming back over and over. Why? The handling - the driving experience. There are so few cars on the market, in my opinion, that combine compactness and great handling. Having driven other compact makes, I find that the Beetle is heavier, handles better, has better features and more road presence. While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc.;The large shelf dash makes front passengers feel like they have tons of room;volkswagen_new_beetle
06/21/2007;timeino;I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer. I was missing it terribly! Last month I bought a new 07, yellow this time. I'm so happy to have a Beetle again. It's easy to park, fun to drive, cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar, economical to keep the tank full. These are cute little cars. I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town. (It's much loved and still looks great.) I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one, it will also find the right person to love it. In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth/fabric seats.

The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well. I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year, and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well. Though it presents some restrictions, I do appreciate the Bug's styling, as it sets it apart from other cars its size, ;Styling that sets it apart from all other small cars. Handling.

The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for.

How about power seats (sit higher, too), locks, mirrors, a better stereo (MP4), free DVD navigation, cool electronics? Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots. Give it a better trunk lock. How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top? Give it more power. The handling needs work. It has a firm ride, cut the sponginess.

Had to take it in for repair when the transmission started slipping out of gear.

06/29/2009;VIP;Had to replace pads and rotor only at 15K miles. Dealer said that this is normal. I just think 15K is still not that much miles to worry about your brakes. My other cars usually get up to about 30K to 35K miles. The repair is also very costly. $419. This is my first time to own a VW and probably my last too. The car drives great though but maintaining it would be quite expensive.;Handling and performance are great.;volkswagen_jetta
06/21/2009;bklyngal;This is a great car for the price. I bought it pre-owned and consistently drive it everyday. The car now has 38,000 with no problems (knock on wood).The steering on this car is tight and hugs the road. None of the other cars I test drove such as, the mazda3 and corolla could compare to the solid feel the Jetta has. This is a classy looking car and it turns heads, not to mention it's fun to drive. If you want a good looking car with style and great steering, get this car-you won't be sorry! ;Looks, solid feel while driving, great steering and firm seats.;volkswagen_jetta
04/24/2009;johnny;I have had the car for 25,000 trouble free miles now and have enjoyed all the car has done for me. Installed drop in k&n filter in place of factory filter and this helps car to breath better and gives car better tip in throttle response, especially when a/c is in operation. Replaced rear pads at 23,000 miles which should be covered under warranty but is not. VW needs to cover this issue under warranty. As long as you take your vw to dealer to be serviced, and drive it in low rpm range when cold you should not have problems with this car, as I have had no problems with my previous jettas. Also volkswagens aren't supposed to stand and warm up, drive off immediately after starting!;firm seats are good for my back, heated seat to warm me after skiing, esp in snowy conditions, side mirror heaters, washer fluid heaters, attention to detail that some don't notice or appreciate. Solid feel at any speed.;volkswagen_jetta
04/16/2009;bc;I have had the car for 2 yrs. And I have already had to replace the clock spring in the steering wheel. The rear pads wear out so fast do to to abs and electronic stability control. It controls the the car by applying the rear brakes;;volkswagen_jetta
03/25/2009;Joe;Overall the car has been reliable, but several problems have developed. First, it developed a bad smell due to mold in the A/C condensor. Lysol didn't work so I had to take it apart and clean it with bleach. Now we turn the A/C off a few miles before arriving at our destination and let the condensor dry. Then the lifts on the trunk wore out, which means the lid doesn't automatically open anymore. The third problem is a mild ticking sound from an exhaust manifold leak. It's not too bad since I can only hear it when accelerating moderately onto the freeway. Fortunately, it doesn't appear to be getting worse. I'm debating if I should take it to the dealer, lest something else get screwed up.;Power is adequate and can be prone to smoking the tires for some distance with the ESP traction control off. I found this out by accident one day when I decided to see if the ESP made any difference. I think the car is more fun with it turned off. What do you think:) Car has lots of cool features.;volkswagen_jetta
03/24/2009;Justin;This is my dads car. I drive it all the time, but i also drive my moms 2007 rabbit which I prefer to drive. The Jetta just doesn't stop like the rabbit at all. And it doesn't accelerate. The steering is almost the same but not quite as good as the rabbit. Overall I think that it is a good car but not great.;Leather, Sunroof, and Stock Stero;volkswagen_jetta
01/23/2007;new Jetta;I just purchased my first VW Jetta and it rocks, the Wolfsburg Edition is really handy with the heated seats. At first I thought I had no reason to have them until I turned them on during a cold front. I tell you, you can't have leather seats without them. The same goes for the sunroof, at first I thought I've never had one so who cares, but now that I have used it is a great option to have. Thanks VW for the hard work in creating and evolving the Jetta for today's environment.;The ground effects and spoiler, chrome grille, wheels and heated seats.;volkswagen_jetta
01/18/2007;Stratman;This is our first VW since owning a Scirocco in the late 80's. We have the 2007 Jetta Wolfsburg Edition with the 6-speed automatic. We love the styling, ride, power and fuel economy of this car. But in the terms of safety, this car is fantastic with front and rear side curtain airbags. I hope we will not have to use them but if so, they're there. The power is quite adequate and we have already taken a few trips in this car and the ride is quite comfortable. Also, the heated seats are a very nice edition on those cold days. The rear seat and trunk room are very nice as well as we love to travel and can fit much luggage in the cavernous trunk. All in all, this car is a great addition. ;The leatherette seats, ride, trunk room, heated seats, intuitive controls, rear climate control, styling, and safety features.;volkswagen_jetta
01/17/2007;Dave Havriliak;"Simply put, this is a car of great compromise. This is my first VW. I wanted to reduce my operating costs due to rising fuel prices in the middle of 2006. Therefore the Jetta was considered. I am really glad I got one. It will be used as a commuter car that will get 100 miles per day put on it. As of today it has about 8,000 miles. I am getting 28 MPG (mostly freeway 72 MPH average with cruise control and regular unleaded). I use Mobil 1 synthetic (0- 40 wt) oil. Although the 5-cyl. engine lacks a little torque in the low RPM range, the 5 valve head runs pretty decent if you need to put your foot in it (above 3,000 RPM). I am 6' 1"", 205 lbs and find the Jetta to have great comfort. ";The satellite radio, smooth transmission, great ride, roomy trunk. nice interior design, easy to change oil/filter, easy reset maint computer. My son-in-law enjoyed the guitar for Christmas. I am glad to find nice people at VW, since Honda was acting too arrogant for me.;volkswagen_jetta
01/13/2007;Michael;Driving the 2007 Jetta is like driving a sporty luxury car. It comes with every option that I would want. ;The great price and heated windshield washer squirts.;volkswagen_jetta
01/12/2007;Kristen;This is my second Jetta and I have to say that VWs to me are better than my Toyota Tacoma and Corolla put together. That's why I went back to driving a Jetta. I also feel much safer, than in my Toyotas.;The overall appearance. ;volkswagen_jetta
01/11/2007;chachi313;This car is a great car to drive. It handles pretty nicely. Its shifting is crisp. Just be careful you could break 100 mph without even noticing.;The Aux input for my new guitar and iPod.;volkswagen_jetta
01/09/2007;mboggian;When I searched for my first new car, I had focused on Honda, as I have had good experiences with Hondas previously. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the VW Jetta. It is small on the outside and big on the inside, there's plenty of space for passengers and storage. It's a lot of fun to drive. The only drawback it has is it gets lower gas mileage than I would like. I can justify this by attributing the lower gas mileage to a heavy car body, which serves as an excellent safety feature.;volkswagen_jetta;volkswagen_jetta
01/03/2007;BKM;The 2007 Jetta is a very appealing car, but I don't like driving it. The ride is very rigid and feels like riding in an old beat up truck.;The appearance.;volkswagen_jetta
01/01/2007;Babbo;"This is not a sexy car, but it offers good service and comfort at a very favorable value. ""The People's Car""";The overall value of the Jetta is hard to beat. My new 2007 is my 4th VW and it is good to see that the company finally decided to get back to it's core roots. Mexican assembly has helped keep the cost down so let's hope that German work standards have not been eased.;volkswagen_jetta
12/29/2006;MrBill;Right off the lot I my Jetta needed a wheel alignment. The car moves from side to side going down the road after the alignment. I am being told that is the way the car drives. I have received bad customer service to the point that nobody cared. Now it is three weeks later and the sunroof leaks. This car has 3,000 miles on it. Look twice before buying one.;The dash is laid out nicely.;volkswagen_jetta
12/26/2006;Sarah;This is really a great car - it is fun to drive, has a very smooth ride, and handles turns and corners very well. It picks up speed very fast and the Tiptronic transmission is great for people who like to drive. I am very impressed that Volkswagen has taken the initiative to make so many safety features standard and my insurance went DOWN after purchasing a brand new car. It is great - I love the styling and it's just a lot of fun.;I love all of the safety features, the sunroof, and the red and blue dash display helps to set it apart from the green and orange of other cars. The Jetta's smooth ride, comfort, and pick up are great. I could just keep going!;volkswagen_jetta
12/24/2006;Erik;I bought this car and was happy with it until I started driving it further than a few blocks and winter came. It has no comfortable seating position. Also, the defroster does not heat the bottom part of front window, which leads to snow and ice buildup under the wipers. The transmission whine makes it sound like police are always present, when it's not grinding its gears. I used to have a V6 and the average gas mileage on that was nearly 20% better than I get on this car (though EPA ratings show it the other way around).;At least there is not much wind noise on the highway.;volkswagen_jetta
12/22/2006;KCVW;This car is a very good deal. It comes with ESP and all of the safety equipment, top crash and dynamic safety ratings for $17,500. I like the car overall. Its front seat comfort is only so-so for me, but the ride is very good. Its performance is fine, but its gas mileage is just OK. Nothing feels better at highway speeds (any speed you choose) than a VW. That makes them great cruisers. For the money it's quite a deal.;The ride and handling.;volkswagen_jetta
12/20/2006;Larry;This car has excellent fit and finish with upscale materials. The poor man's BMW is back with Class. Our other car is a Chrysler 300 and the Jetta has a smoother, quieter ride. We went with the 5-speed for the sports sedan fun, but the auto transmission with sports shift was a strong contender. The exterior styling is a little bland, our neighbor thought it was a Corolla and it reminds me of an old Altima. It has a smooth shift, but the quiet engine makes it easy to stall. Ironic huh? The multi-adjustable console/armrest is great. So far I would choose this car all over again. ;The color combo...black with beige leatherette is very stunning. The seats are very comfortable, they hold you in place with good lumbar support. The great crash test ratings a plus in the Jetta. This car has solid road handling and pulls you through the curves. It has a great rear view mirror. The interior red/blue instrument lights are easy to see.;volkswagen_jetta
12/03/2006;SleepyDoc;The Jetta Wolfsburg is similar to the 2.5 trim, but adds a sunroof, convincing faux leather seats, rear center armrest, alloy wheels, and floor mats in addition to the cold weather package. It is available in black, white, silver, and gray. Its understated exterior styling belies the quality of the interior. It's even more impressive at night. Soft touch materials are used extensively, and even if you find hard plastic, it has a solid, quality feel. The exception being the paper-like shift boot. The ride is firm yet very compliant, excellent road manners. Its acceleration is acceptable from stop, but highway passing is effortless to a flaw - watching for flashing lights is compromised by rear visibility. ;The interior is amazing for a car that costs less than $20,000. I like the ambient red lighting at night. It has substantial passenger and cavernous luggage room (bigger than my previous Taurus). I like the torquey, great sounding engine. All-in-one package with no options needed.;volkswagen_jetta
11/25/2006;SarahR;I recommend VW as a brand to anybody. They are great cars that hold up forever. They are smooth riding, safe, and they look nice without being snotty. I really love this car.;The smooth ride, the fit of the car, and how it is very comfortable.;volkswagen_jetta
11/22/2006;Dan;I love the car. I had a great experience with the dealership and service has been great.;I like having a manual transmission along with all the top of the line upgrades.;volkswagen_jetta
11/20/2006;snowdance;This is a nice ride. It's quite inside and has a nice shifting transmission. It handles well at speeds and through mountain corners. It delivers great power at all RPM. It is far nicer than my '95 Mercedes 300CE. VW has come a long way.;The large trunk and comfort for long trips... I put in a couple of 780 mile days. This car is a joy to drive at any speed and on any road.;volkswagen_jetta

11/14/2006;JesseJ;I purchased a 2007 VW Jetta 2.5L. I like the looks of the Jetta from the outside more than I do the inside. Overall, it is nice and fun to drive. It is a good vehicle for the money. I didn't look at any other car except for the Honda Civic, but didn't like its new body.;The handling.;volkswagen_jetta
11/08/2006;Jetta Lover;This car is stunning to look at and has loads of power, with the Tiptronic transmission and sports mode providing a whole lot of thrills. It has a surprisingly spacious interior and more than enough room for three sets of golf clubs. The standard 6 disc sound system is impressive and the leatherette seats are almost as good as the real thing (and far better than cloth). The fuel economy is excellent. It's a lot of fun to drive and can fit into virtually any parking space. I'm seriously considering buying another one for my wife.;The stylish looks, loads of power, great fuel economy, and lots of trunk space.;volkswagen_jetta
11/07/2006;Aaron Lozano;I drive a lot. On average, I spend about 50 minutes in my car daily. I'm currently at 25,000 miles on my '06 Jetta. It's been a year since I purchased my spice red Volkswagen Jetta and I'm still very pleased with my decision. Although it was not my first choice, I find it to be a beautiful car that is strong and enjoyable. On a separate note, the dealership is not as helpful. It is the only dealership that offers Jettas in my area, so I have no choice. The service department has been very rude to me on one issue. Still, overall I love my car. ;);volkswagen_jetta
10/26/2006;Dave;This is a great vehicle to drive. It's fun and sporty, but also very safe and economic. Great job Volkswagen.;The Aux input In is my favorite feature. It allows me to use my iPod.;volkswagen_jetta
10/06/2006;TripVWowner;I really like this car, I think the exterior styling which is considered bland by some is sort of sporty and elegant and it shares the same large chrome grille feature as VW's luxury counterpart, Audi. The car handles very well and I have the base 2.5L 5-cylinder engine which may not be race car fast but does the job. I notice that the car is very heavy for its class and I like this as it helps keep the car feeling more stable at highway speeds. ;For me the thing that sold me above all else on the Jetta was the quality of the interior materials. I looked at many other cars in its class and none come close to the interior quality of the Jetta. ;volkswagen_jetta
09/14/2006;Bob;"This car drives and handles well. It's fun to drive and is nicely appointed, but it's the most expensive Jetta package, costs over $25,000. Trading in a '01 V6 fully loaded Passat, I didn't want to give up any extras. The new styling is great, and the upgraded 17"" wheels make the car stand out. I did not test drive the car on the interstate before buying...big mistake. The road noise is very noticable, much louder than what I'm used to. I keep turning up the radio to compensate. If I had it to do over, I probably would have looked more at a midsize car and checked for a quieter ride. If you're looking for a small car and can get past the road noise, it's a nice car. ";"It has a nice leather package. The steering wheel controls and digital information center are neat. I like the upgraded 17"" wheels. It has good trunk space for a compact car.";volkswagen_jetta
02/08/2009;Bill Baker;I bought this car for the looks even after hearing about problems with this car. I am so happy with this car and all it hasdone for me.

I've driven in NE snow/weather for 20yrs and this is THE WORST car I have had for snow. If there is some magic button I need to press, I wish someone would let me know. The dealer here is terrible...it takes forever to get an oil change. My trunk lift broke 4mos after getting the car, and the dealer had the nerve to ask ""what did you do to it?""

10/04/2008;katelin22;About six months after I bought my car (my first car ever), the splash shield separated from the bumper and crumbled into a million pieces on the freeway. I took it to the dealer, and they said that my insurance should pay for it and that this happens all of the time because the European make of the car causes it to catch on US parking curbs. I went to my insurance agent and they said they weren't going to pay for it, because it wasn't due to an accident. I had to pay $1800 in repairs out of my own pocket. I have since had problems with my driver's side door, and my brakes almost didn't stop my car on a hill.

09/16/2008;CJ;As I read through the reviews, I agree with the brake issue. I had to replace my rear left brake system completely at about 10K miles. The rear caliber seized and wore down my pads and bent the rotors. I am now close to 18K and having another brake issue. I have had 2 other cars of which I put well over 100K each and did not run into this problem. If it were not for this problem, I would say the car is great. Awesome handling and great pickup. Very comfortable on long road trips. Just fix the brake issue!;Nice sound system for being stock. I like the interior design, especially the stick shifter...nice detailing. ;volkswagen_jetta
09/03/2008;badbrakes;Not a bad car overall. But I guess some lucky few (including me) have experienced defective brakes. I had to replace the rear pads and rotors at 21,000 miles and now again 9,000 miles later! VW claims this is normal wear and tear. I've owned and driven many cars and never had to replace pads, let alone rotors before 40,000 miles. There is no brake wear indicator light for the rear brakes, only for the front. The rotors are designed so that they have to also be replaced every time the pads are replaced.

07/21/2008;Franco;"After test driving some Japanese makes (you can imagine which ones), I finally made it to the VW dealer, and it felt like I had been driving go- karts all day! This felt so solid and drove so well. I loved the tiptronic transmission and the VW signature blue and red display on the dashboard! The mileage this car gives is also very respectable. This was the last car I test drove. The 6'6"" salesman opened the driver's door wide open when we got back to the dealer, hung himself from the door for about 7 seconds, and then closed the door. It closed as if nothing had happened. He looked at me, smiled and said: ""Do not try this on a Japanese!"" I thought this was a funny remark.

06/20/2008;Holly Pryor;I have been reading everyone's reviews about how they love this car. Personally I have not had a good experience. I have had a knocking noise that sounds like it is coming from the dash on the passenger side that sounds off every 1 min and 15 sec. The airbag warning light stays on, the brake warning light stays on, the signal warning light stays on, and periodically the power steering light comes on and the steering acts crazy. I have already replaced the rear brakes at 20,000 miles when supposedly the rear brakes only get used 25% of the time. I have already been to the dealer twice. I need a car that I can depend on as a single mother and this car is definitely not it. ;volkswagen_jetta;volkswagen_jetta
06/14/2008;Devin Christiansen;"This is MY first VW, and my family's twelfth, so I am a little biased on my love for the car. The fit and finish is luxury level, the ride quality is (for me) close enough to my old 3- series BMW that I can't justify the added expense of the BMW anymore. The only complaint I have is the rear brakes which seems to be a common complaint here. I will say this though, having had to replace the pads nearly every oil change, I will continue to pay for that hydraulic braking system.

I use this as a commute car and I will never buy a VW again because of this issue. I like the car but I can NOT believe that VW has this problem and will not correct it. This is an on going problem from the 2000. If you hear a thud in the rear brake area you have a problem that will cost you $400.00 because you have to replace the ROTOR and PADS.

12/31/2007;big guy cool car;I always wanted a Volkswagen ever since my brother got one. I finally got a jetta wolfsburg and I love it. When you want to hit the ground running it responds immediately. One of the main reasons why I went with this car rather than a Honda is because I love the expensive look of the car, the little details and strong sheet metal that holds it all together. I recommend this car to all my friends. ;Sunroof, blue and red dashlights, build quality, leather look alike, tons of standard features, sound system the small but powerful engine and I kind of like the loud exhaust note.;volkswagen_jetta
12/29/2007;TucsonDesertRat;Well, you may think I'm crazy going from high-performance to economical but, this car still holds to the same fun as the EVO 8 w/o the speed or the cops always looking your way. I choose the GLI because of it great features it offers the features of a BMW 3 Series without the sticker price and you get all the extras that the EVO didn't have! GREAT gas mileage! The in-dash display that almost tells you everything about your cars status is pretty cool too! I'll miss the HP and torque of my EVO but, not the highschool kids always trying to race me! ;-) Good job VW!! ;volkswagen_jetta
11/11/2007;Bruce;I was somewhat hesitant to purchase a VW because of everything I had read regarding the quality of the car, but I was pretty much sold after a test drive. The 2.0T has much better performance, exterior styling, in addition to what I believe is higher quality interior materials than the other cars I was considering (e.g. Accord, Camry, Altima). The only weakness I can see so far is the fuel mileage and the car's requirement for premium gas. The car has been averaging about 22-23 mpg in mostly city driving. While this is in line with the EPA ratings I had expected better. I haven?t done any long distance highway driving with the car yet so I can?t comment on the highway performance.;Turbocharged engine, heated seats.;volkswagen_jetta
11/10/2007;Ben Cooper;Since my husband has purchased my 2007 Jetta, it has been the best experience I have had. This care is the compact and fast. The take off is awesome.I drive to and from work which is about 13 miles. It's the smoothest ride for such a small car. After having it for two years I will trade it in for another VW Passat. ;The inside interior is smooth leather and in interior lights are great. The automatic power window for front and back.;volkswagen_jetta
11/09/2007;Andrew W;I purchased an 07 Jetta GLI Fahrenheit (6-spd manual) May of 07. I have been very impressed by how well-balanced this car is. It is a reliable, efficient, practical, and fun vehicle to drive and own. I have averaged 25mpg with a typical mix of highway and city driving. The interior build quality is far superior to any other auto in its class. Fun and exhilarating!;Best steering wheel ever! Above average trunk space. Sporty leather seats. ;volkswagen_jetta
10/26/2007;Sheila;"This is our 4th VW. The Jetta is our first ""new"" VW. It handles beautifully and has enough power to get into traffic. Test drove a Corolla and Camry the same day we tested the Jetta and the Jetta won hands down just due to the fun factor. Only problem so far is the door latch on the drivers door catching, and the outside temp gauge. It uses a little more gas than we expected, but the alternative wouldn't be much fun to drive. The sport shift is great.";Excellent handling, braking, simultaneous 4 window control, large trunk, pop up trunk lid, 6 cd changer in dash (instead of trunk), windshield wipers slowing down at red lights, set volume on stereo to be same at each start up, and increase on hwy. ;volkswagen_jetta
10/08/2007;DanTheMan2007;This is my 2nd Jetta, 3rd VW in all. My '98 Jetta got well over 30 mpg. My '07 averages 18 mpg! I've been back to my dealership 4 times and they basically tell me 'too bad'. I contact VW Corporate and they told me I have to work with the dealership, and that Corporate has nothing to do with it. Overall, I love the car, except the gas mileage and the lack of power (feels like 4 cylinders, not 5). I'm very disappointed in VW on the way they handled this issue.;Fun to drive. Headlights are very bright. The car is sporty. Power windows and radio still work after you turn the car off. Keyfob trunk release is cool as it opens the trunk for you. Two power jacks in the car. Moonroof air vent is cool. Turn signals on side mirrors are nice.;volkswagen_jetta
10/06/2007;Krystle;The Volkswagen Jetta is awesome. I took this vehicle with me to Vegas and got almost 40 mpg on the highway. ;My favorite feature is the heated seats and cruise control.;volkswagen_jetta
10/03/2007;Nic;I have a black over tan Wolfsburg. The color combo just pops and looks classy. The interior textures and materials are the same quality as my previous Mercedes. It's got all the fun stuff like heated seats, mirrors and washer nozzles, ESP, traction control, 6 airbags, Tiptronic sunroof and more. I haven't been able to lose control of the car even when I try. Feels solid and safe and looks great. There is no other car out there for the price with the quality and features you get... not even close. I love this car, I hope the reliability is as solid as the way the doors shut.;Turn signals in the side view mirrors are a cool touch. It's nice that you have like 25 different speed choices with the windshield wipers. A/C vents for the rear passengers and A/C for the glove box!;volkswagen_jetta
09/27/2007;Dominick;I love this car.;The Sport Transmission feature plus the option to shift manually provide a lot of flexibility in different driving situations.;volkswagen_jetta
09/23/2007;Joe;We bought a white Wolfsburg Edition with a tan leatherette interior and have been very satisfied. It has a quality, well insulated interior and the exterior resists chipping from pebbles very well. Although it can only muster a 17 second quarter mile time, it feels quicker in the lower gears thanks to the 6-speed auto. It also cruises effortlessly at 80 mph and has good passing power at freeway speeds. The car handles well with a firm but not too harsh ride. It also has very powerful brakes with an emergency brake assist system that has the ability to apply full braking force in case the driver does not. Overall the car has a solid quality feel to it and seems to be thoughtfully engineered.;Moonroof, sport mode, ESP, emergency brake assist, adaptive steering, telescoping wheel, lights in mirrors, individual interior lights, 8 speaker stereo, large trunk, storage compartments, glove compartment cooler, heated seats, keyless entry, rear a/c vents, magazine pockets, dashtop vent.;volkswagen_jetta
09/20/2007;Disappointed;"Bought new on 8/31/07, returned 9/1/07 for my AC and heating not working. So far, VW has had my car for 2 weeks and expects to have my car another 3 weeks due to ""production problems"" for the part that my Jetta requires (sensor/compressor). They say this problem just started occurring in the 2007 models and they aren't equipped to handle the need for so many parts. I'm now sporting a Mercury Sable that I pretend is my Jetta :( Extremely disappointed in VW, but the time I did have it I enjoyed it. Just afraid that I now have a lemon on my hands - what brand new car breaks after 1 day??? BUYERS BEWARE!!!";Trunk space, good pick-up, lots of features, handling.;volkswagen_jetta
09/17/2007;Cameron James;Everybody wants to spend their money wisely, as do I. If you're in the market for a new or used vehicle, this is the way to go. A must see car, if you have not before. So many standard features, so little price. Check it out, and compare to other choices. You will not be disappointed.;Luxury items, like heated leather seats. And big time safety features. You don't have to look for lower insurance, just buy a Volkswagen!;volkswagen_jetta
09/17/2007;Lyndy;I bought this car in January and already have 13000 miles on it. The dealership has given me great deals on maintenance and I haven't had any problems. I love how it drives and it is easy to handle. This is the first new car I've ever bought and it's great. So far it's been a reliable, low maintenance car! ;MP3 auxiliary jack, sun roof, leather interior.;volkswagen_jetta
09/07/2007;Tom;We just bought a base Jetta with 6 speed automatic transmission and love it. Good throttle response and decent power from the 2.5 liter five cylinder engine/6-speed automatic transmission combo. No problem issues to report and the best highway fuel mileage so far has been 33.6 mpg keeping a steady 70 mph. At around 80 mph, the mileage is consistently 29-30 mpg. We've been averaging 22-25 mpg around town. We drove a lot of cars before settling on the Jetta for its cost, features, safety, comfort, and handling. The handling is perfectly stable at 80 mph on the interstate and yet nimble in town. Nothing else came close.;Build quality, many standard features, handling, comfort. Excellent tiptronic 6-speed automatic transmission.;volkswagen_jetta
09/01/2007;JettaDriver;This is my second VW Jetta that I have purchased. I traded in my 2004 Jetta GL and upgraded to the 2007 Wolfsburg Jetta. I couldn't think of any other car to purchase. It has always been reliable, great on gas, a smooth ride, and held its value very well. So far I am very impressed with the changes on the interior. Since the 2004 model they have added the temperature gauge, arm rest/console, mp3 jack, etc. The safety features are awesome too!;The sunroof, alloy wheels, and the VW emblem inside the headlights.;volkswagen_jetta
08/21/2007;Kevin;I had a 1987 VW Jetta and I had the worst experience with it. I thought after 2 decades VW finally got better. Oh boy I was wrong. The 1987 was made in Canada and Mexico, and when it needed repairs I had to buy German parts at very high price to repair the car. Same story with the 2007 model. It's made in Mexico and the workmanship is VERY POOR. Just within 2 months the car started to fall apart. This car is a mechanical nightmare. No wonder more and more people buy Toyota. Just after 1 month the master cylinder (for brakes) needed replacement. 4 days ago, the car overheated on the way to Vegas. I made a huge mistake to buy this car. What good is 6 airbags when it is always in repair shop?!!;Interior design.;volkswagen_jetta
08/20/2007;usferic;I just purchased my VW Jetta. It is the closest to a BMW I will get for a while and so far I love it. It is fun to drive and has tons of features, I am finding new features everyday. So far I love this car. I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a reasonably priced sedan with lots of features.;Great acceleration, lots of room, tiptronic transmission, comfortable and quiet ride, large trunk, heated seats, sturdy, lots of safety features.;volkswagen_jetta
07/23/2007;jettalover14;This is my first VW and I have to admit I've always dreamed of owning one. I went into the dealership to buy a rabbit but saw the deal on the Jettas and fell in love with this car. Her name is Annie. Yep, I named her. I love everything about this car. It's functional, holds insane amounts of my stuff (I moved three times this spring in it), the gas mileage is just awesome, I have everything I want. Cup holders, easy to reach radio and CD controls, a beautiful blue glow at night, bright headlights, I can't say enough about the steering. This car is just fun to drive! ;Love the night blue glow, the sound system is outstanding, the arm rest is a plus and the solidity of this car is awesome.;volkswagen_jetta
07/21/2007;Michael;I drive a lot. I have about 12000 miles on my Jetta and I only bought it in January. I went with the wolfsburg and it has everything that I wanted in a car. ;The monster mats that came standard with my car have kept the carpet clean even in muddy slushy winter weather. ;volkswagen_jetta
07/07/2007;Jen;Overall I am in love with this car. The exterior styling is attractive without being excessively flashy, the interior is well thought out and welcoming. The steering is excellent, and don't be fooled by the 150 hp; the torque more than makes up for it and gives plenty of passing power. This car has a very solid feel for such a little thing. My only disappointment with the Jetta is its gas mileage. I've observed about 21/25, which is a bit inferior to other cars like the Civic or the Accord. Overall I am more than willing to make this trade off since I see a billion Hondas on the road every day, which makes me feel a bit more unique in my happy-looking Jetta. :);volkswagen_jetta
07/01/2007;Pogi;We absolutely love this car! This is my wife?s car but I try to make excuses everyday just to drive it. The 2.0T engine is fabulous! No turbo lag and handling is great. DSG is amazing! I am not sure why high end cars don?t have DSG. This will be the benchmark for sequential gear boxes and the future of changing gears. The finish is fantastic. VW has put the fun back in the Jetta. Reliability is still a question mark. Hopefully VW fixed this issue. Overall, this car is a sensation! Should you get one? You bet you should.;Almost everything in this car is great! 2.0 turbo engine is fast, torque everywhere, DSG is unbelievable - handles like an F1, responsive steering, quiet ride, etc. I can go on and on. Looks sporty and luxurious. Good gas mileage (25-32 mpg). Built-in satellite radio, 6-disc CD changer, etc.;volkswagen_jetta
06/27/2007;PlatinumGLI;I've only had the car for a few days now so these are my initial impressions. Look for another one by me in about 3-6 months. So I came over from a 2005 Volvo S40. The GLI performance and fun to drive factor is miles above the S40. The comfort and ergonomics are significantly less than the S40. Initial impressions: strong build quality (it sounds and feels very solid). Performance is fantastic. I love its style. I know it's very safe. Good visibility and great trunk space. The MFD (trip computer) is a bit confusing at first, it's not as user friendly as what I'm used to. Stereo has great features but sub-par sound (much better in Volvo). More details to come later - check back! ;Performance, DSG transmission with paddle shifters and tiptronic options, style (except for tail lights), wheels, chunky steering wheel, trunk space, interior dimensions, exhaust growl, platinum gray color, satellite radio, aux input, launch control (haven't tried yet), aftermarket compatibility.;volkswagen_jetta
06/18/2007;Dorene;I am very pleased with this purchase. Not too flashy, not too boring. Fun to drive. It comes at a bargain price with lots of features that would normally cost extra. It handles great, and feels safe and solid. I went into the whole car shopping process fully expecting to buy another Honda Civic, and this car is much better. My first VW, but probably not my last. No regrets here.;The dash lighting colors are very nice, seats are comfortable, and the trunk is cavernous. ;volkswagen_jetta
06/13/2007;Customer;I've owned 2 prior VWs (2002 Passat and 2005 Jetta), all have been reliable. So far, after 6 months, this Jetta is proving the same. I picked the VW over competitors for the options and the drive.;Heated seats, iPod connector, room, pickup.;volkswagen_jetta
06/06/2007;Brooke;I bought my second Jetta 3/07. I was a fan of my 2002 GLS manual Jetta but WOW do I love my 2007 automatic Wolf! So much more pep and the interior leatherette and heated seats are great. Averaging 30 MPG highway, which is better then my 2002 manual was. I'm about to hit 5000 miles and so far this car is the best. I will stick with VW for my next car too b/c for the money you can't beat all that you get.;Leatherette, heated seats, sunroof, great stereo, tons of airbags, huge trunk, gas mileage... I could go on an on!;volkswagen_jetta
06/05/2007;v-dubber;This is a great solid car. You get the convenience of a sedan but with more personality and fun. It's roomier than previous models. Trunk space is great, and grocery hooks are handy. The tire pressure monitor is a plus. The low profile tires are a little sticky, so rides on the highway can be bumpy and uncomfortable for some. The premium fuel recommendation could be pricey even with the good gas mileage. I'm a little concerned with VW's past reliability history, but so far I've been pleased. I chose this over the Acura TSX because I like the sportier feel and its features for price. I actually don't mind the drive to work!;Package 2 leather seats, aluminum trim and pedals, bright xenon headlights, trunk space, smooth turbo power, thick sporty steering wheel, lane change feature, multifunction steering wheel, gas mileage, the blue and red interior displays, blue tinted glass;volkswagen_jetta
06/02/2007;Tim;What a huge difference over the previous model. It has made a transformation into an adult jetta. The size is greatly improved and it feels much larger. ;Wolfsburg edition.;volkswagen_jetta
05/30/2007;jettablue;This truly is the next best or closest I can get to an A4 without feeling like I got the cheapest thing available. The value this car represents is incredible especially when looking at standard features. The ride is quite comparable to an Audi A4 although perhaps a bit softer. ;The torque is amazing!! Don't let the horsepower numbers fool you. Drive it!;volkswagen_jetta
05/27/2007;Dave;After several American and one Japanese car this is my first European sedan and so far I couldn't be happier. Handling is great city or highway driving. Steering makes parallel parking a breeze. While the acceleration off the line is average, passing on the highway is easy. You won't get the gas mileage of a Civic or Corolla, but the Jetta is not terrible either. I'm getting about 29 mpg on the highway and with all the standard features and quality of the interior, I'll take the Jetta anyday.;Love the design and quality of the interior. Lots of trunk space and the Sirius radio is a pleasure.;volkswagen_jetta
05/27/2007;Scarlett;I have had this car for just under a year and just got hit today by a unattentive driver doing 50 mph. I and my car are going to survive. How many small cars can you say that about? I love this car - people complain about engine noise but it's not bad and the stereo system has a function to get louder (subtlely) as the speed increases so I never notice it. It is safe, stylish, fun to drive, and reliable. I haven't had any problems and after today when my car was being towed away to the body shop I realized that I love it even more now that I know it really does keep me safe. I would recommend this car to anyone and I love that VW took the initiative to make safety standard.;Smart radio, tap turning signals, 6 STANDARD airbags, safety features, styling, comfort, gas mileage, reliability, full size spare, TONS of standard features.;volkswagen_jetta
05/19/2007;Shawn;Everything about this car is just awesome. But the most important thing is the turbocharged 2.0 engine, boy it really flies without any turbo lag. Love the ride!;DSG automatic transmission.;volkswagen_jetta
05/18/2007;Fred F. Stone;I traded a Lincoln Continental for this. I think it was a good move. It was time for something smaller. Gas mileage is great. Pick-up is amazing. I got the drivetrain of a GTI with a more comfortable suspension. Seats are a good fit, driving position is near perfect. Brake pedal is a little too close to the gas pedal. Wide shoes become a problem. Radio sounds great. I like the MP3 jack. Should have had a recess in the glove box lid to allow cable to pass out without crimping it. The AC power outlet in rear of console was a pleasant surprise.;Tilt/telescope wheel. MP3 jack. Comfortable seats. Large trunk.;volkswagen_jetta
05/12/2007;Roger;In 6 months I realized how poorly designed it is and you get real concerned about the long term reliability of this vehicle. When you get into the driver's seat, you will always have to dodge the side bolsters. The car's ventilation system makes clicking sounds and this is normal according to VW. My car since the purchase date sometimes refuses to turn over when started, nothing wrong that VW could find. Trunk release does not open in cold weather. If you want an oil change, either buy your own filters or go back to the dealer, nobody stocks them. Gas fuel door was replaced under warranty as well as rear fender clip that holds bumper in place. ;Perfomance of the car. Good gas mileage but need premium gas.;volkswagen_jetta
05/02/2007;Gabriel Lopez;Car handles like it costs in the 30,000 mark, offers standard equipmant when others put it at extra cost, interior finally better laid out after all these years!;Water bottle holders, audio auxiliary output.;volkswagen_jetta
04/25/2007;Cholie;This an overall great car. My husband and I really like the boxy look from the back and the ground effects are subtle but make the car look great it gives it a fuller look. The seats are a little hard, I find my self adjusting the seat a lot to try to find some comfort and I just can't find it. I also wish they all came with standard steering wheel radio controls. The ride around town is great, but on the highway it gets kinda shakey. ;Heated seats, leatherette, all the cup holders.;volkswagen_jetta
04/12/2007;J;I bought the Jetta thinking it was a German car that was pricey but worth the money due to the materials and workmanship. I am incredibly disappointed. When I picked up the car the keyless entry didn't work and the radio had interference. The dealer to date is unable to fix the radio. It sounds bad enough to drive me crazy and not terrible enough for the VW people to care. They replaced the radio once and it still is not fixed. Even worse I had to visit the dealership 7 times to have them keep trying to fix it. That is not including the 8 times for them to fix my keyless entry. I have only owned Hondas until this VW. I will never buy a VW again.;Handling.;volkswagen_jetta
04/09/2007;dj;"Overall, I like the car but, they need to go back to the drawing board with the driver's seat. It is not comfortable if you have a short torso and I have to use a lumbar cushion if I drive very far. The seatbelt receiver is very low if you have to elevate the seat (it elevates up and forward) and it is so rigid (not like the flexible, higher version used for the passenger seat) that it causes the seatbelt ""handle"" to jab deeply into your hip and cause severe bruising. I am an average sized person and have never had this type of problem with any car that I have driven in 30 years. Be sure that you test drive the car with the seat adjusted to your fit and drive it around awhile. ";Gas mileage... averaging 31mpg, trunk space.;volkswagen_jetta
04/06/2007;GB;This car is surprisingly quick for a base engine with automatic. The six speed trans is very smooth and is programmed perfectly. Handling is excellent and performance in snow is very good. The interior is very good, but I'm not sure I like the placement of the cruise control lever. Love the heated seats and chilled glove box. Sunroof is very well designed with little wind noise even at highway speeds. So far there have been no problems with any part of the car. ;Heated seats and controls. Sunroof. Interior design.;volkswagen_jetta
04/05/2007;W Brown;"I purchased a used 1.8 Turbo (2003). My pleasure at owning this car led to the purchase of our new Jetta. I am greatly pleased with the handling and performance of the new Jetta. It does, however, seem so much ""bigger"" than the older car. The Tiptronic trans. is excellent, and snaps off manual shifts faster than any human could perform.One of the most impressive things about the car, is the build quality. Truly German, a poor man's BMW.";Acceleration!! Braking! Highway cruising.;volkswagen_jetta
04/04/2007;kpad1ne;My girlfriend works for Volkswagen & I was skeptical when she bought her 07 Jetta.I am a die hard Nissan/tuner enthusiast & I am amazed with the performance & smooth ride of German vehicles, in this case VWs Jetta.The car has great acceleration & good power considering its weight & remote 150hp, but could pack a punch when you need it to.The 6spd auto/DSG feature is great & the comfort, interior quality, & ride is amazing, not to mention the car is affordable.Black is the best color for the Jetta as it highlights all of its elegance & compliments the chrome front grille the best.I am in love & will be purchasing one for myself, the GLI of course.;Great acceleration for only having 150hp, smooth & comfortable ride, interior gauges have an awesome color, and most importantly a best buy for the price compared to other vehicles within the same class, doesn't feel like you're driving a tin can like most of these imports-VDUB has found a new fan!;volkswagen_jetta
03/18/2007;Greg;"This is my first ""new"" car. I also own a 1965 El Camino, and have been looking at new cars for three main reasons: 1) safety, 2) comfort, 3) gas mileage. This car was the only one that I was looking at in the $20,000 range that had full side curtain airbags for the driver, passenger, and rear seats. The bucket seats are very comfortable for long driving periods, and the car's estimated gas mileage is 22-30 mpg, though I find myself getting about 24-26 mpg on regular-unleaded. This is not my dream car, but for a college student who has a shallow wallet the price for what your getting is defiantly superior to comparable models.";This car has good interior and exterior design features that pay attention to detail. For example, tap the blinker lever and the blinkers blink three times then disengage. This keeps my hands on the wheel and my mind on the road.;volkswagen_jetta
03/16/2007;jessie brouillette;I have had my Jetta since 09/05. I have only had one problem with it, which was the truck latch didn't work all the time. They replaced it and I have had no problems since. I have owned Hondas and the Jetta is much better built car on the outside and inside. Especially the seats, they have better quality leather. For people who are shorter, the inside is user friendly and comfortable. ;The body style and interior design.;volkswagen_jetta
03/15/2007;ProudJettaOwner;This is my second VW Jetta. I traded in my 2000 Jetta for the '07 Wolfsburg and WOW, what a difference! I actually bought the car, not loving the exterior, I bought it for the interior and everything it had to offer but since I have had it, I have grown to LOVE the body as well. ;The 6-speed automatic transmission and 5-cylinder engine. It is a h huge difference from my 2000 Jetta. I love the interior as well, and heated seats are a plus.;volkswagen_jetta
03/08/2007;Nicholas;The Jetta Wolfsburg was a welcome choice among the many configurations of the Jetta. It has just the right combination of options for the price, and is substantially less expensive than if you put the same option packages on the regular 2.5. The car is adequately responsive in the economy driving mode, but shift into the sport mode and it becomes a MUCH more powerful animal. Living in California, I find the Tiptronic to be especially useful for keeping the RPMs up for easily passing other cars on the many freeway mountain passes. While the last generation body style was more inspired, the current Jetta's lack of exterior edginess is more than made up for with its SUPERIOR interior. ;6-speed Tiptronic transmission, heated seats, aux. input for iPod, and interior room and styling. ;volkswagen_jetta
03/05/2007;UnHappy;Looks can be deceiving! This car has a very uncomfortable ride. The seats are back killers. Whenever I drive the car for more than 30 - 40 minutes the middle of my back tightens up. I've never had back problems, but now whenever I drive the Jetta for more then 30 minutes, my back tightens up. Adjusting the seat hasn't helped. In 35 years of driving dozens of vehicles, this is the worst ride I have ever experienced. I wish I could sell it without losing my butt. VW's response was there isn't a design flaw. I'll never buy a VW again! ;volkswagen_jetta;volkswagen_jetta
03/01/2007;Sam in Utica, NY;My Jetta Wolfsburg constantly surprises me. After the 1,000 mile break-in, my gas mileage was 34 MPG on my last trip. The car takes regular gas, not premium as noted in some articles. It has plenty of pep with the manual transmission. I drove an automatic five cylinder and was underwhelmed by it's performance. Do yourself a favor and buy the 5-speed. You'll save over $1,000 and have more fun driving. My last Jetta was an '03 Wolfsburg with the 1.8T. The 2.5 reminds me of my old Jetta, but the quality and reliability of the '07 has greatly improved.;The black exterior with beige interior;volkswagen_jetta
02/21/2007;Larry$;I purchased this car as an alternative to the GTI, GLI and Rabbit. The GTI and GLI were just too expensive when loaded up with the options I wanted while the Rabbit even fully loaded seemed lacking to me. The Wolfsburg Edition is a joy to drive, it handles as nicely as the others in my opinion, and even with the 2.5 has more than enough zip for me. I use it mostly for my commute to work, 25 miles one way and also to load up guitars in the trunk for repair work I do on the side. The trunk space is huge and can be expanded into the back seat area - a big plus for me, the main reason for the GTI and Rabbit was cargo space. This car gets about 30 mpg highway which accounts for most of my driving.;The console and dash lighting is awesome, with two small detail lights over the console to give some light while driving. The sport mode on the Tiptronic is to die for. The detailing of side panels and plenty of crash protection are a major plus for any car, this has both. ;volkswagen_jetta
02/20/2007;LuvTheJetta;I researched other cars for about 3 months before I bought the Jetta Wolfsburg Edition. No other car could match the performance, safety, and features with the price of the Jetta. I love the standard options on the Wolfsburg. It is sporty but very comfortable inside. It's fun to drive and I've been happy with how powerful it is while maintaining decent gas mileage. ;The heated seats, sunroof, roomy interior, well-designed exterior, blinkers on the side mirrors, large trunk, fold- down back seat. ;volkswagen_jetta
02/08/2007;IL-VW;VW's exterior and interior material are much better than those that are used in most import and domestic autos, but mechanically I think they need to improve. We are currently having issues with oil consumption of 1 quart of 5W-40 synthetic oil ($5-6) every 1,300 miles and a soft brake pedal on cold starts. VW claims that 1 quart per 1,000 miles is normal. I do not agree with this, I think they got this spec. from the VW Bug. The dealer and VW Corp. will not fix these problems. Please, do your homework before you buy any VW. Try http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ for consumer complaints before you buy.;It has a nice exterior and interior.;volkswagen_jetta
02/02/2007;IML8;This is my second Jetta. While I am still partial to the old body style, I love the interior of the new Jetta and the extra room it provides. The biggest reason I bought a Jetta again was for their safety record, as I was recently in a head on car crash (I was in a Jeep Liberty).;The safety features.;volkswagen_jetta
02/02/2007;Kathy O;I looked at a lot of cars, and decided that the Jetta Wolfsburg Edition was the one for me. It has plenty of punch, a quality interior, and all the right extras. I didn't think I could get something so solid for what I was looking to spend. I love my VW. ;The options package is great (I live in the Northeast, where nasty weather is a problem). The telescoping steering column is also great. Auto up/down on all 4 windows is also great - I can't wait to enjoy the car in the summer weather as well!;volkswagen_jetta
02/01/2007;NJ Steve;I traded an '01 Cavalier with 136,000 miles on it for a VW Jetta Wolfsburg. My fiancee has an A4 Audi. These cars are very similar, but not the same. So far, other than the vanity light not working (dealer repaired), the car is great. It has lots of power, handles great, and it's comfortable. I wish it came in blue though. I think we are going to trade the A4 in on a Jetta GLI and save $6,000-$8,000. It just has no quattro AWD. I was leery about the car being built in Mexico. I was going to buy a Rabbit 4 door that was made in Germany, but for $500 or so more, I went with the Jetta and am glad that I did. I would not recommend the dealer though. They were typical BS artists with no product knowledge! I knew way more about all VWs than them.;The heated seats, acceleration, comfort, saftey, and handling!;volkswagen_jetta
01/28/2007;Matt;I just traded in my '01 Wolfsburg Edition for the new '07 model. The engine is solid;" it whines a bit at low speeds but has enough juice. The lack of a Turbo takes some of the ""fun factor"" out of it. The old one had one, but the lack of a turbo but probably makes for a more reliable ride. The styling is OK, it's grown on me a lot since I first saw it. I used to think it looked just like a Corolla but now think it looks a bit more distinguished, especially in black. It has lots of thoughtful extras. Overall I am happy, it has modest power, convincing leatherette, a moonroof, a 10-speaker stereo and heated seats plus a good warranty for under $20,000. I shopped the Altima (great but more money), Civic/Accord, Camry, and Fusion. This was the clear winner.";volkswagen_jetta
01/26/2007;Sonia;I've only had this car for three weeks but so far I am very pleased. It has a really smooth ride and is surprisingly roomy. I like the quality and simplicity of the interior, and for 150 hp, it's got quite a bit of pep.

01/26/2007;Jetta Family;"We have owned five Jettas. Our new Wolfsburg may be the best one yet. If you don't like the European ride and handling, do not buy one.

It drives great and feels like a tank compared to other Japanese cars that I had test driven prior to this one. To show me how well built it was, the 200 lbs. salesman hung himself on the door for 5 seconds, and the door still closed perfectly! He said: ""Don't try this on a Honda."" I thought that was funny. I love the Tiptronic automatic transmission and the sports mode, which gives me a pseudo-manual feel of a sporty driving experience. The rigid suspension helps in this as well. After test driving several makes and models, as soon as I drove the Jetta I knew that was my next car.";I love the heated seats! It only takes them about 30 seconds to warm up, even when starting the car on a winter morning (I do have a garage, though). Also, I love the MP3 connection.

Solid(a very comfortable tank), stable, superb handling with 16-inch tires, 6-speed auto shifts effortlessly and almost imperceptibly, great acceleration, and a genuinely fun driving experience. Fuel economy is in keeping with what the vehicle offers in the way of horsepower and performance. I drive mostly highway and get about 30 mpg with a spirited driving style.

Being a rather large individual 6'5"" tall and 245 lbs. basically eliminates me from about 90% of the cars in the market, and this includes a lot of trucks and suv's. However, the Rabbit has loads of room. I have more than enough leg room, headroom, and shoulder room. When are the Japanese and American car companies going to get it???

05/01/2009;jordan23;"In general, I'm pretty happy with this car. I had a problem with a rattle at the top of the dash, but the dealership fixed it without charge. Quite a bit of tire noise-probably the 17"" wheels. The door mirrors are quite small so you have to adjust them perfectly-used to hate this but not anymore. No reliability issues at all. Handling is very solid-buckled down generally, but a bump in a turn will upset the chassis. Great safety with all the airbags and traction/stability. The cabin feels very open with high roofline-very nice visibility. Comfortable even for the long haul. Generally a joy to drive. At this price point the Rabbit can't be beat. Would like power/DSG/handling of a GTI though";The ergonomics are top notch. The layout of the controls is very intuitive. Feels very solid - both handling and build wise. Has a lot of storage room - fold down the back seats and be amazed. Nice to be able to shift semi-manually to get best performance and mileage. Aux jack is amazing...love it!;volkswagen_rabbit
04/20/2009;Karl Muggenburg;"As a 6' 4"" enthusiast, my requirements are elbow room and fun to drive. This car fills the bill! I have had several VWs,and many others in the compact class since 1955, and this 2007 2.5 is the best overall! Solid and secure at ANY SPEED. By far the best overall combination of features and useful sophistication per dollar. This car is better than the maker says it is. Brakes and handling as delivered are outstanding, the engine and driveline give performance well ahead of its price class. If this 2.5 were available with the 6-speed manual, it would be a best buy by far! ";Ergonomics and ride quality are in a very high class all by themselves. Build quality is totally above reproach!

Good Performance, the Torque is great for this car. It handles pretty good. not problems with this car at all. Also, the oil change, you can do it in several places, like Goodyear, good people, good price for a synthetic oil. the brakes are really good, it could be better, but i cant complain. even i have driven my Stock Rabbit into a track race and it performs really good in corners.

11/26/2008;Marissa;I have had my Rabbit for 2 years and have loved driving it. The problem with this car is that, when something happens to it (or even when you need an oil change), you'll be put in the poor house. Beware, the Rabbit is very high-maintenance and pricey once off-the-lot. I was lightly rear-ended, small dent: $900. I drove a dirt road leading to a mountain hiking trail and hit a bump, transmission needs to be replaced: $7000. Even an oil change: $90. I will be saving the $7000 needed to put in a new transmission and choosing a reliable, low-maintenance Japanese car, like I had before.;Fun to drive;volkswagen_rabbit
02/04/2007;Matt;I tried to find a better deal on a hatchback used and domestic (even went to car auctions). This two door appears to have more room than the four door Focus. What sold me was the vast range of features and powertrain. It is a huge improvement from the Mark IV Golf with its four wheel independent, five cylinder, and a very smooth shifting six speed Tiptronic transmission for only $17,000! The plastics on the exterior protect exactly where the car would get bumped in parking lots. Plus it has traction control, heated mirrors, ABS, cruise control, six airbags, laser wielded frame, and daytime running lights...the list goes on. I would love to sell these for a living.;"It even has orientation lighting that gives you that ""dark room"" ambiance. Six speed automatic sport mode is a lot of fun. ";volkswagen_rabbit
02/01/2007;2intwenty;I purchased the Rabbit a week ago, and am enjoying the well-designed interior and great drive very much. I find the car very well-named as it feels very much like a quick and nimble little rabbit. My only caution is the engine noise, and I feel the 2.5 to be quite thrashy-rattling around 2,000-2,500 RPM under acceleration. I am sincerely hoping that this is not due to a developing engine problem. Time will tell and I will update periodically. ;The wonderful VW interior and German fit- finish. This car truly is finished like a price class beyond. The 6-speed auto and great stereo are my other favorite features. Its handling is near top of the list too. I really am enjoying this little guy. ;volkswagen_rabbit

01/26/2007;budderfly;I am one of those uncommon Americans that loves hatchbacks! I love the engine they put in these cars as well. It is very speedy, smooth and quiet. It has a nice interior, beautiful paint (United Gray in my case), and it is overall practical and classy. Nothing seems garish or cheesy about this car. I decided on the Rabbit over a Mini Cooper. I seriously inquired and test drove both cars. The Cooper was cool, but the engine lacked, and the styling struck me as over the top (semi-tacky). I also felt cramped and bit frightened for my safety. Traded in my 2005 Jetta. I get 25-30 mpg mostly highway driving. To me that is fairly decent, especially since the car is a 5 cylinder 2.5L. ;The sunroof, alloy wheels, heated seats, and 5-speed manual transmission.;volkswagen_rabbit
01/19/2007;Craig Vedder;I am very impressed with the pick up of the 2.5L Rabbit. This is also matched with a great feel of the road and the perfect amount of engine noise.

Detail is key for me - they even put little VW logo's on the headlight assembly.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
01/08/2007;Megan;After three months of driving my 5-speed, two door Rabbit I was in love with it. That is until last week when someone t-boned me at about 60 miles an hour. After the car spun 360 degrees, I got out and walked away. I work at a personal injury law firm and have seen plenty of similar accidents where people have permanent injuries, and all I ended up with was seatbelt burn. For the money, you can't get a better quality or safer car. I can guarantee when I get my settlement check from the insurance company I'll be buying myself another Rabbit.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
12/27/2006;Uncle B;"I like it so far. I've only had it for a few weeks. It doesn't get the gas mileage stated but I was also told that it would take a few thousand miles for the engine to break in and then I would get the good gas mileage. It's getting about 23-24 mpg and I drive mostly around town. I noted some of my dislikes below but for the most part VW really did it right and most of it is all standard. That is what I love most is that all the ""extra"" features are already standard on this vehicle!! I show mine off to friends and they all ask how much this or that cost me extra and I say ""Nothing!""";My wife loves the heated seats. I love the 6 Disc CD changer and the red lights that glow just enough from over head to allow you to see the interior at night without it being a distraction. I also love the color of the stereo, dash and interior lights and the Tiptronic Auto Shift control.;volkswagen_rabbit

The commute to work is somewhat enjoyable while zipping through traffic in my sporty new VW. After driving a Hyundai Accent, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, and a Scion xA, I drove the Rabbit. Needless to say this car outperformed them all and had all the safety and convenience features included in the price. The Civic and the Hyundai had a/c available for an extra $900, what a deal! I'm happy with my purchase and I feel safe driving my two young children in this car.;The key is neat. It is so fun to flip it open and closed. The automatic transmission with the Tiptronic and sport settings makes driving fun. I also like the blue lights on the instrument panel. ;volkswagen_rabbit
12/10/2006;A. Kaplan;"I fell in love with the Rabbit when I first saw it, and probably bought it too quickly (especially with the great trade-in offer and the deal I got). After about 3,500 miles, I decided the car wasn't for me. I lost about $2,500 on the car but bought a fantastic 2004 Saab 9-3 lightly used for roughly the same price (what Rabbits are retailing for). I just didn't enjoy the ride, everything ""makes sense,"" and on paper the Rabbit is a technical marvel, but it's also not very fun to drive. Also, the gas mileage leaves A LOT to be desired.

12/09/2006;jim;I am very impressed by this vehicle's performance capabilities. It picks up quick when you need the power. It was between the Matrix and the Rabbit. Both were similarly priced, but the Rabbit came in a bit less expensive and it is more fun to drive. This is my second Golf (Rabbit). My first Golf was purchased new in 1987. I had that car for over ten years. I finally sold it to a friend. We are still friends, haha.;The performance pickup is this car's best feature, followed closely by the car's very upscale interior. I like how the seats are designed to grab onto and hold the driver in place. The suspension over bumps is remarkable.;volkswagen_rabbit
12/09/2006;Great Hatch;For $15,000 how can you go wrong? I sell cars and I learn a lot in the business when it comes down to the fit and finish of a car. Besides the Honda Fit, this is the best bang for your buck. The power is untouched by any of the competition. Most cars in this segment have 110 HP. When it comes down to the interior quality build, you have a car with high quality material and of course a lot of features you would have to pay more for in other cars. This is the best $15,000 brand new car you can have. The only downside is the gas mileage, but who really cars when you compare the fun factor of a 150 hp car to a 110 hp car. Get one.;The fit and finish and yeah the horsepower.;volkswagen_rabbit
12/08/2006;Rabbit Girl;Going from a 2003 Jetta 1.8T with 180 hp, my new Rabbit is a bit of a change. The peppiness isn't as much as my previous Turbo Jetta and the tires are not very smooth. Its ride is a bit noisy with the 5-cyl engine. Other then that, it isn't too bad for the price. It is better than a Japanese vehicle, despite what they always say about reliability. The Rabbit has it.;The blue dashboard lights. The hatchback with the VW logo as the actual handle to open the hatch is a super cool idea. The radio memory buttons where you save your radio stations actually shows you what station is saved, which is fantastic. One less thing for me to remember.;volkswagen_rabbit
12/03/2006;steve;I have had my '07 Rabbit for over a month now and it's been great. I test drove many cars in this segment such as the Mazda3, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, and Hyundai Elantra just to name a few. The rabbit was by far the best value as far as safety and standard features for the money are concerned. This is a car that I actually look forward to driving. It feels and drives like I spent twice as much as I did. It feels like a BMW 3-Series at half the cost. This is my first German car and I am very impressed. This really is a driver's car. It's a very well built, solid, fun to drive car with every safety feature in the book and a great warranty to match. What more can you ask for?

So much for German quality control? Anybody out there has experienced the same thing?;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
11/25/2006;Mauri Trevino;Civic? Mazda3? Rabbit? I too looked at each, but in the end the Rabbit was simply better. Feel the solid laser-welded construction of the Rabbit over a rough road. No goofy-fad interior either, clean, functional design with everything in clear view and reach. The most underrated: the engine. Some say 2.5L should have more horsepower, but then they haven't felt the Rabbit's torque. It pulls strong without winding revs. The 2.5L engine allows torque on tap and makes the driving experience something the others can't touch. Who wants to rev to 7,000 every time you want to pass? Not the people driving Rabbits! Oh, about the weight, yes its a little high but check out the crash test ratings. More metal is safer!;The safety, optional rear thorax bags, fold down passenger seat, laser welded unibody, shifter feel, 5-cyl. sound, and the interior at night, Wow! I also love the low road noise, traction control, rear passenger air vents, adjustable armrest, full size spare, and the slot for the owner's manual in the glove box.;volkswagen_rabbit
11/22/2006;af britton;I used to drive a Suzuki Forenza. Don't get me wrong, that was a nice car but there was no aftermarket parts and no horsepower or performance in that car at all. The new Rabbit beats out any car you can find for the price. With the new engine being in the Jetta also you can find all kinds of parts for it. VW makes a number of cosmetic parts which lets you make your car unique. There are a lot of cars out there now days that say they get incredible gas mileage. I have driven those cars and I am not going to pay up to $10,000 more for a lot less of a car. This car get great gas mileage. I am very pleased with what VW has done.;"All the ""standard"" options that would cost you thousands more in upgrade packages in other cars.

I went from an '02 Golf GLS to an '05 Jetta GLS (prior to march '05) waiting for more horsepower at an affordable price. I was able to opt out of my current lease and purchase the 2007 Rabbit. The car handles like a dream. It pounces on command, zips when needed and delivers a smooth transition into cruise control, an upgrade in my eyes.;The 150 horses in such a stylish and compact,roomy affordable car. The sound system is awesome the bucket seats hug you. Merging into traffic is a breeze. Oh yeah, let's not forget the overdrive, what a great feature.;volkswagen_rabbit
11/21/2006;Brian;I traded in a '01 Audi A4 for my '07 5-door Rabbit. I loved my A4, but I love the Rabbit more. The only feature missing from my Audi is the Homelink and auto-dim mirrors. Everything else is just as good or better. This was definitely not a step down. Everything about this car is just right and the value is unbeatable. It's quick, fast, and super comfortable. You're not likely to come across many others out on the roads, so it's cool to be driving a unique car. I agree with the poster that said if they made this any nicer, it would be an Audi. I thought I might regret not getting the GTI, but I definitely do not. While I love the 2.0T, this 2.5 is a fantastic engine.;Sport Mode (auto), torque (minus the chirping tires!).

It has 153 miles on it, so I am in the honeymoon phase for sure. After looking carefully around, I decided the Rabbit was the best value around for about $20,000. It is quiet, peppy, and tight as a drum, with a fab interior -- which is so much nicer than a Japanese interior it is a little hard to believe the price is comparable. My Dad had a '77 Champagne Edition Rabbit when I was in HS, and it was also tight and fast. He was horrible at maintenance, and got 220,000 out of it.;Wow, where to start? The windshield has superb visibility. The interior is incredible for a car of this price - no fuzzy seats here! The urban cockpit is over the top (but I like it) with more lights than a 747 at night. The sound system is awesome, and there is plenty of leg room in the back.;volkswagen_rabbit

The car drives great, feels great inside, and is just all around fun to drive. Now that I've had it a month, there are a few things I've noticed. Its gas mileage has been 20 / 25 mpg, it has some odd noises here and there from the pedals, and the stereo seems like it is possessed at times. Other than that, it is packed with a lot of things that I wouldn't have expected for the price. And I get a guitar...what could be better?;The ten speakers, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, heated side mirrors and seats, aux input, sun/moonroof, spacious interior, full size spare, blue lit instrument panel, how all four windows are automatic, the front armrest, the two ac power inputs, up/down + key engaged closing... and the key itself is awesome.;volkswagen_rabbit
11/07/2006;Marty;I have been researching the hatchback market for awhile and finally settled into a 4-door Rabbit. It's superior in so many ways to the Dodge Caliber, Toyota Matrix, Honda Civic and Mazda 3. I love it's looks, refined interior, long list of standard features, performance, ride, fit & finish and how it is so quiet. It has everything I'd want in a car at a very reasonable price. It is a small economical car with NO compromises.;The Tiptronic transmission with sport mode and manual option is unbelievable. The stereo and quiet ride. The handling, performance and low end torque. The efficient use space. I also love the heated seats, sunroof, climate control, and tons of standard safety features. ;volkswagen_rabbit
11/01/2006;JDyck;Simply put, this car blows away the competition with its combination of build quality, design, safety, and standard features. 'Nuff said.;The characteristic VW build quality.;volkswagen_rabbit
10/29/2006;sunni01134;"I traded in a 2000 Golf for my new Rabbit, and although I technically ""downsized"" since I went from a ""fully-loaded"" Golf GLS to a ""base-model"" Rabbit, I do not feel like I am missing anything (except the sunroof, but oh well). The standard features on the Rabbit are great. I got the added ESP system and the 16"" alloy wheels, but the features built in are awesome. The dash is redesigned and great, the passenger room is much more spacious, although the truck lost some space, but thats cool. The brushed chrome also looks awesome on black. Thanks to VW for bringing back the black on black interior. I was scared that I would end up with that stupid back on beige. Go buy yourself one :)";The dash and console, and of course the engine pick up.;volkswagen_rabbit
10/25/2006;eldaino;The Volkswagen Rabbit is wonderful. It has such a solid feel to it, you won't be able to find a more solid feeling car in it's price range or even a bit above. The gas mileage may not be amazing in this class, but most other cars on this class don't have five cylinders either. I wish the redline was higher but other than that power is fine. This car is very peppy, if it was any lighter it would be too fast! It has great interior ergonomics and quality materials are used throughout. It is better than my '06 Civic. It is not as futuristic, but the build quality actually feels nicer. It has nice handling, not too harsh and sporty but no wimp either. It is very pleasant, fun, and a great buy plus it comes with a great warranty. I love my Rabbit!;The classic VW gauges in red and blue. This car has the best interior of any car in its class and pretty much beats any American or Korean car that costs thousands more, and is on par with if not exceeding Japanese brands like Honda and Mazda. It has a very refined look, nice handling, good torque, and a very quiet interior.;volkswagen_rabbit
10/25/2006;Bogdan G.;I previously had a 2002 VW GTI and loved the car. The only reason that I didn't go with the GTI but with the Rabbit is because there is no 4-door on the GTI (I know they have it in Europe). In my opinion it is the best car in its class. It looks great, feels solid, drives sporty, has a roomy and classy interior.;I love this car's 170lb.ft torque, 150HP 5cyl engine, 6-speed auto transmission with manual mode, 10 speaker / 6 CD sound system with Sirius radio, sporty seats, and how all four windows have auto up/down.;volkswagen_rabbit
10/21/2006;JS;I've had this car for about a month and so far I'm thrilled with my purchase. Everyone notices this car and asks me what it is. I am not very tall, but the Rabbit has great visibility. VW rates the fuel efficiency as 22 city/30 hwy, but I've been getting around 24-26 city mpg. I'm very pleased with the acceleration of the inline 5-cyl. engine, yet it still has decent fuel efficiency. It is roomier than expected and has a lot of cool creature comforts. This car has a lot of bang for the buck. All the safety features are STANDARD, while other cars I tested had extra charges for side airbags and ABS and traction control. This car had the most features for the best price. ;Being short, the telescoping steering wheel is great. I don't have to be afraid to have my face smashed or my ribs shattered by a deployed airbag because I can set the steering wheel at the correct distance. The 6-way adjustable seat is comfy. I can't wait to get the adapter to play my MP3s! ;volkswagen_rabbit
09/28/2006;Aaron;Three weeks and two tanks of gas later I can say I have loved every minute in this car (especially at night ... you'll see). Although I do have to say it's been a real challenge driving moderately to break in the engine. Three weeks without redlining or driving full-throttle is absolute torture in this car. You can get up to 50 mph in second gear (and it's hard to keep it under that speed). I'm happy to report that the car's gas mileage is better than expected. The first tank of vigorous city driving achieved 24.7 mpg. The second tank I drove moderately (which equals somewhat aggressive driving to me), about 30% / 70% city / hwy driving. I achieved 30.3 mpg. This car has solid handling, performance, and a reasonable price.;The exterior styling is more refined than the previous model Golf. And the interior is a class above the Honda Civic. This car is made from sturdy, modern materials like you'd find in a BMW or Mercedes. All of its buttons are intuitively placed. The speedometer / tach displays are very sporty and refined, not gimmicky. ;volkswagen_rabbit
09/24/2006;portagekix;This car is absolutely great. I bought it last week, and I have just crossed over 100 miles. I have a manual tranny, and it is simply a blast. to drive I can't wait for the break-in period to end. The stereo is loud with the stock ten speakers (the Honda Civic I drove had six, and it's not even close). This vehicle comes with every safety feature you could want, and it is the base model. I would suggest getting rims. Mine came with 16 inch rims, and it just gives the car a better finish. This is my first new car. Anyone considering it against a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan needs to know the choice isn't even close. VW's feel more finished and polished. They are also much more fun to drive.;I love the amount of room in the car. I am 6' and all my friends are too. The front passenger seat has almost too much room, which gives us plenty of room in the back seat. I also love the stereo and how quick this car is. The 2.5 five banger does not dissapoint.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/24/2006;chadfoo;The Rabbit is an oustanding vehicle that is built solidly. It has great engine performance, a suspension that absorbs most road bumps, and it glides on the highway at high speeds. You get many standard features that are optional in most cars at this price. The hatchback is very versatile and spacious. I negotiated the price down to $16,000 with auto trans only. Consumer Reports' bottom line price was $15,760, so use that as a reference. Its power steering is something else, its turning radius perfect. The gas mileage could be better, but with the engine they have included that is shared with the Jetta and Passat, it might worth the extra money spent on gas. The 6-speed transmission automaticly shifts smoothly. I highly recommend this car.;The speed adjusted wipers, lane change feature, Triptronic shifting, A/C cooled glove box, hatchback handle in the VW logo, CD player with 175 watt stereo, MP3 input jack in the glove box, 6 airbags, and the overall engine performance.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/13/2006;Ohio Jim;I bought a base manual 2007 Rabbit and was surprised at how much equipment comes standard. It has power locks/windows and an MP3 player for example. To get that in a Civic I would have paid at least $3,000 more. Of course, with VW if all that still works in seven years I'll be stunned. They definitely used some cheap plastics in the interior. I've eyed three things that will surely be broken before the warranty is up. The poor quality history not withstanding, a great car for the money, mainly because the performance is fantastic. It is just plain fun to drive. If I wasn't so scared of the quality issues and notorious electrical problems I would have opted for the Tiptronic auto that I test drove - that thing rocked!;I like how the Rabbit has 150 hp in sich a tiny car. Its handling is fantastic. Its styling is great for a compact car, too.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/09/2006;calpolyrabbit;I was excited to own my first very own car a few months ago when I bought a Scion xA in automatic. After being rear ended and having the car declared totaled, I ended up buying the Rabbit in manual 2 door paying about a grand more than I did for my xA. I think this car drives and feels much more luxrious and upscale to the xA and '01 Civic LX of my past. Though it is harder when trying to fit people in the back only having 2 doors, Then have plenty of room back there. I am one who likes buying cars from manufacturers who builds cars in their country as my xA was made in Japan (Toyota). The Rabbits are currently made in Wolfsberg, Germany. I am sincerely impressed with my purchase.;"The interior lighting at night is a pleasure. The blue and red is slick, clean, and easy to read. The seats feel a lot more comfortable than those of my past cars as well. There are lots of ""Easter Eggs"" such as nice turn signal blinker functions, windshield wiper goodies, and others...";volkswagen_rabbit
09/08/2006;dragonlips;My only complaint really is that they seem to feel drivers of the 4 door model should be more comfortable than those of the 2 door model. The seat in the two door Rabbit is not as adjustable and it is missing the front middle arm rest. Otherwise, I love the car. I have had it for four weeks now and already need to get it in for it's 5,000 mile check-up! Oh and of course the dealership had no clue (anyone) about the stereo input.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
09/03/2006;Hop-A-Long;I had been waiting for VW to launch this NEW GOLF V for the past three years. I researched the car for a very long time. Being built in Germany at the Wolfsburg plant, she really is a IMPORT! I have the 4dr auto with Tiptronic, and I LOVE IT. Now that it has arrived it has been dubbed the Rabbit! Even better, the legendary car IS BACK! And with this car, the legacy lives on. The look, the feel, this car has it all. VW has hit a big home run with the new Rabbit. The 4-door version has LOTS of room. When people get inside they just look around puzzled that though small on the outside, it is very vast on the inside! The Tiptronic 6-speed transmission is fun, fun, fun! The new 150 hp engine also kicks hard. Don't let this 'lil car fool ya. Hop, Hop.;I like the a/c cooled glove box, I don't know why, but I like it. Also, the 6-speed Tiptronic gearbox...let's you do QUICK work on ANY time consuming errands! I like the optional SPORT mode in the transmission. The key rolls ALL four windows up/down from outside the vehicle! The vehicle lives up to the old RABBIT nameplate very well.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/01/2006;VW;I have over 3000 kms. on it and love it more every day. This is my 6th car (4th VW) and is my favorite by far. I love the handling, acceleration, looks, interior, and especially how quiet it is. It has tons of room inside and I really like how everything is laid out inside. I actually like the cruise on the stick and it is very easy to use (unlike previous Jetta models). It makes for a cleaner looking steering wheel. I have had absolutely no problems so far. It is built like a tank.;The acceleration and handling are fantastic and by far my favorite thing about the car. I also like the one touch signaling feature and VW nameplate latch. This car has wonderful engineering. I think VW just did a great job designing this car. I give it top marks!;volkswagen_rabbit
08/23/2006;JpL322;"This is the first VW I have owned and my previous car was a '91 Honda Accord. I love the preformance of the 2.5L engine paired with the manual transmission. The interior is deceptively roomy to me (6'2""). The quality of construction is the best that I have seen from all of the car companies I have shopped (Dodge, Chevy, Honda, Toyota). This car is by far exceptional in quality, options, and preformance for the price.";"I love the number of options that come standard. It is amazing compared to the standard options that are offered by other car companies. The base VW Rabbit model comes with more features than what Honda Civics come with when ""well equipt.""";volkswagen_rabbit
08/21/2006;Greyman99;I have only owned my Rabbit for a couple of weeks, but already know I will not regret the purchase. It is sensible for an in-city driver like me (3-5 miles/day most days). You get a lot of car for a little price, without throwing the extra $6,000 down for the GTI version. This car is very stylish and remarkably roomy inside (my parents are jealous--they have a new Beetle). Plus, unlike a lot of the 2-door Hatchbacks coming out (the Yaris at $11,000--ha--only if you barely have air-conditioning), the Rabbit comes pretty loaded at the base package. It has power everything, cruise control, etc. I am looking forward to the accessories packages to outfit the base model (be warned: floor mats are not standard, for some reason).;The engine, tossing a 2.5 liter into this little thing gives it plenty of get- up-and-go, even without any Turbo mods (though I might get those anyway...).;volkswagen_rabbit
08/12/2006;red07vdub;At first I didn't know if I liked the new Rabbit, then I went on a test drive in one. I never thought that the 5-cylinder engine would have that much pep to it. They also did the trick with having a lot of features in the standard base priced model. Not only is the car affordable, it gives you more than you money's worth in fuel economy and the options. I love my new Rabbit.;I like how they have LED lights shining down on the gear selector (5- speed), the light his the chrome trim and makes it stand out like none other. I am also a big fan of the blue on red instrument panel.;volkswagen_rabbit
08/10/2006;Chicago VW Fan;I just purchased a 2007 Rabbit 2.5 5-door on 8-5-06. I went to a great dealer with great salespeople. This is our fifth VW. This car's fit and finish are superior. I am impressed with its numerous safety features - see IIHS for crash test results. Its 5-speed manual transmission is smooth and slick. Its handling is awesome - it really hugs the roads. Its accelleration very pleasing as well - especially with the 5-speed. The interior materials are first class. The rear seat leg room comfy for a 6-footer. Its cargo area spacious. I use this vehicle to drive to work - 40 miles round-trip. So far it is averaging about 28/29 mpg mix city/hwy. This is one well-built-fun to drive-good looking automobile. Hats off to VW.;The accelleration, 5-speed manual transmission, fit and finish, nice interior materials and room, handling, safety features, good dealer experience, hatchback versitility, fun to drive character, price and warranty. I am totally in love with the sound of the 2.5L engine during hard launches...it is very pleasing to the ear. ;volkswagen_rabbit
11/19/2008;Sean Hunt;Like most VW's the handling and feel is great. It is a heavy car with a large 5cyl engine. It is a loud engine and the Transmission is not properly tuned for the engine. We had the premium sound system that had the base flare problem...i found a service bulletin on the internet and contacted the dealership and they fixed it under the warranty. The transmission does not downshift until it is almost at a stop. So when the car is going 30mph its still in 5th or 6th gear. And it starts sputtering a bit. Also the tiptronic manual shift has a loss of RPM for a moment in second gear after the shift. And we are noticing a slip and clunk shifting move. I think VW will find a problem soon.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
11/18/2008;cpo;My 07 Rabbit is a great car, very fun to drive and handles well. My MAJOR complaint is the brake system wears out the rear brake pads in record time. This seems to be a design flaw, based on my research. My rear brake pads are completely gone after 21,000 miles. ;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
10/19/2008;radouane;It's a lovely car. I had one for the past 2 years and I can't say anything disappointing about it. Very fun to drive. I love the interior, especially the at night when I turn on the lights and see the blue and red well designed dashboard. I think it's the best in its class! ;dashboard design, power, stability, handling, clutch, sporty transmission, and everything else! ;volkswagen_rabbit
09/18/2008;kill the rabbit;"The first week I got the car, it was in the shop 2 times. The radio never worked, widows always dysfunctional. The brakes were going to kill me. AC never got cold. The hatch back broke 2 times. No one can change the oil but the dealership. The back brakes wore out before 30k miles. Things randomly broke in the car. For example, the sun glass holder broke, I forgot it was there until it fell down. It was INSANE! VW kept telling me that I did not know how to use their ""special"" brakes. I almost got into 2 accidents because my car decided to drive off the road during braking. In the End, VW stormed out of the court room and I am buying a Honda. I had a Golf for 2 years, loved it ";heated seats and the i-pod hook up;volkswagen_rabbit
08/21/2008;Atomicbri;Ok I love this car! There is no doubt about it! It drives and handles excellently. I have the auto box and it is excellent. All around this is a great car for the money. I see a lot of owners here saying they are not as happy w/ the mpg and while it is a bit lower, I will take the fun to drive factor any day! I get about 30 on hwy and overall I have averaged about 27 total w/ mixed driving. Overall have never been to the dealership except for maintenance. My dealership is pretty friendly I live in Chattanooga where the new VW plant is being built and so the dealership there just got rebuilt and is top notch!;Love the tranny, love the handling and engine pep. Love all of its little hidden features (when wipers are on regular speed and you come to a stop it slows to intermittent... awesome!) Too much stuff to list I like!;volkswagen_rabbit
07/26/2008;iRobert1989;Have owned the car for about a month now and it is GREAT! Not a single problem with it whatsoever. Has PLENTY of pickup on the highway. The brakes are perfect! I love the Euro-styling. Great radio system. Love the 10 speakers and the satellite radio and the ipod aux and the 6 disk in-dash changer. The 6 Speed Automatic is perfect especially in sport or tiptronic mode. The car comes standard with a whole lot which is nice. ;Sport Mode, heated front seats, in-dash 6 cd changer, in-dash Sirius satellite radio, All the VW Safety, SUNROOF!, GERMAN!;volkswagen_rabbit
07/17/2008;Ricardo M. Huerta;Today I took my car to have a rear braking noise checked at the dealer where I bought it. I knew the problem was with the rear brakes but I didn't figure it to be worn out brake pads and worn metal to metal with less than 20k miles. The front brake pads hardly show any wear at all and now I must spent over $300.00 to fix the problem. Dealer service says that rear brakes wear out twice as fast as the front brakes on this model. I've always known the front to rear wear ratio to be the opposite and more like 3 front repairs for every rear repair. Front brakes handle about 70% of the stopping for most vehicles and are therefore always thicker. I've had other cars so why the quick wear out?;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
07/07/2008;christauph;Almost to 15k miles, awesome handling, awesome braking, decent acceleration (its a heavy car). The clutch and shifter feel great. Overall my experience with this car has been good, but a few build quality issues have arisen. The sheet metal seems to ding easily, I tend to park carefully but have received a disproportionate number of dings in the past year. Rattle started coming from the center HVAC stack at about 8k miles, dealer fixed. The plug for the spare tire compartment came loose and I had standing water , but luckily no rust, dealer replaced. Rear windshield sprayer is cheap, popped off once, dealer replaced. Routine service is EXPENSIVE (syn oil), and difficult to do yourself.;Styling, high quality interior, boat load of standard features, handling, overall reliability.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/06/2008;Thomas Roach;Great car. Sells essentially complete from factory, no hassle with options. Economy just about as sticker, drives so smooth it really is fun. Super value for money and size.;Transmission was big buy point and has not disappointed. Shifts effortlessly and quietly. Car is quiet, and seats are comfortable.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/02/2008;Dave A;I am on my 3 VW, I now have 2 07 Rabbits , 6 speed autos with 16 inch alloys. Both cars have performed flawlessly and have served me well. Gas mileage between 25 and 30 if you keep it on the highway. Little cars will get you in trouble with ability to exceed 125 mph 32,000 on one 24,000 on the other. Very safe cars, Germans are the best at this, why I got one for my wife and daughters.;Handling with the 16 inch alloys ,you can nail a offramp. Pretty good stereo for my rock music . I like the sport mode helps you get better shift points when passing, interior very well laid out, very good gauge layout. Drop the back seats for roomy cargo area, seats up plenty of room for passengers.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/01/2008;VeeDubs Forever;Bought this car, a 2007 leftover, off the showroom floor. I fell in love with it the minute I drove it, and it just keeps getting better and better. When I see it from the outside I can't believe how small it looks - the interior is so roomy and comfortable. This is THE perfect city car. I drive less than 5 miles roundtrip each weekday, then take to the highway on the weekends. The Rabbit is zippy and such fun to drive either way. I love the safety features and the versatility. This is my second VW (2000 Jetta) but my first hatchback and I am utterly amazed by what will fit in this car. But what excites me the most are the high-end features like the wheels, the sunroof,and the heated seats.;Tiptronic transmission (FUN!), exterior access to open or close windows and sunroof, interior features, sporty look, heated seats, Rabbit logo, hatch access, turn signals in side view mirrors, sport mode... I could go on...;volkswagen_rabbit
06/28/2008;Cbrown888;Rented a Golf MKV in Budapest to drive down to Vienna and enjoyed the car so much that we bought one soon after we got back to NJ. The car has not been in the shop once since we've owned it since I do my own service work. The car is great on long trips and handles like a car twice it's price. Bought the Rabbit over the GTI since it doesn't need premium fuel like the turbo charged 2.0 motors. The interior space is excellent and really like the positioning of controls. The overall fit and finish is excellent and typical of a good European car. Overall we'll be keeping this car for a while since I usually get tired of cars pretty quickly;"Looks, I have the factory 17"" wheel and ground effects pkg. The control placement, the standard equipment, the fit and finish and overall quality. the way the car handles";volkswagen_rabbit
06/03/2008;pikers;At my first oil change I complained that the shift lever was violently shaking in 4th gear, so VW replaced the shift assembly. Things went well for a few months and then the shaking came back. I brought it back to the dealer for the 10k checkup and told them the shaking was back. To my amazement they told me they had to rebuild my transmission!! This should never happen with a manual gear box, especially one with 9500 miles on it. But it doesn't stop there. Today the automatic up/down feature for the windows stopped working. I've owned the car for a year and put 9500 miles on it and it has been in the shop for over 4 weeks in one year...not a good ratio if you asked me. ;Fit and finish. The car really is amazing inside and out...you feel like you are in an Audi, not a car costing $16k. There are also a bunch of niceties that you don't notice until they kick in (e.g. the rear wiper turns on automatically when your wipers are on and you go into reverse). ;volkswagen_rabbit
06/03/2008;Nateg;I bought my rabbit on 28 Feb 08 and I now have 5,000 miles and it's ready for its first oil change. In my opinion, VW didn't just change the badge name, but the entire car altogether. Ride is very comfortable. I could ride cross country and not feel stiff. The performance is just right and I feel like I'm in a tank with its safety features. I plan on starting a family soon and I think the rabbit is our new baby carrier. :-) Fuel Economy isn't so wonderful(a 150 hp car should get at least 30-32 mpg not just 25 mpg). I'm also getting some rattle right at the air vent above the radio on the dash and by the driver's side rear speaker. ;Performance, build quality, safety. Quirk VW in Quincy did a fantastic job with financing even though my credit wasn't perfect.;volkswagen_rabbit
05/31/2008;ludwig930;Overall this car is awesome. Great car for the price. This is my 2nd VW (1998 Jetta TDI ) and I enjoy driving it. Not a long distance driver, but has all the essentials for city driving. Great tuner car for those small little quirks, i.e. braking, body roll. Basic model looks a little bland but add some sport springs, nice wheels and some window tint and it takes a little step closer to GTI appeal. Could save a little more money on gas with a 6th gear. ;Ergonomics, lighting, dash: even though it's plastic. It's nicely done. Spacious cabin that seat 4 adults. Option to take off traction control. ipod adapter. ;volkswagen_rabbit
05/30/2008;Better than Zoom2;I read everything there was in Edmunds and then I compared and drove with Mazda3, Scion,Civic and Corolla. No comparisons when it comes to the interior volume as I am tall. I get a respectable 28mpg and I drive speed limits cause I know the sheriff is out for me in my red car. The car wants to go fast all the time. The dealer says it is built to cruise 100mph all day. I believe it! In the flat open highways of my western state this car is a dream and head turner. Make sure your car comes with the Arm rest as it conforms to different positions of the driver's arm. my wife drives with the seat forward and we can slide the arm rest to suit her.;The Arm rest with iPod connector, 3 transmissions in 1, ESP control, the interior look and quality, leg room up front, ;volkswagen_rabbit
05/30/2008;shaun;I have had my Rabbit for over a year now. No problems whatsoever, and it is a wonderful car to drive. One thing I did wish was better was gas mileage, although you get in performance what you lose in gas mileage, so it is a trade off I am happy with. Any of the other similar cars with better mileage can't hold a candle to the get up and go that my Rabbit has.;LED gauges, turn signals on mirrors, 10 speaker stereo system, interior space, overall build quality. ;volkswagen_rabbit
05/29/2008;Becki;This is my 2nd VW. We drove one in Europe and loved it. The Rabbit has a huge fun factor; only thing I really miss is a sunroof. The gas mileage is good but could be better I'm sure.;volkswagen_rabbit
05/25/2008;jdilly;This is my 7th VW since I started driving. My Rabbit is fun to drive and so far has been very reliable.Gas mileage isn't as good as my 96 but the power is much better. Handles very well and is powerful enough to get me out of the way of large trucks and SUVs. Would highly recommend this car. ;Easy to use controls, good torque;volkswagen_rabbit
04/29/2008;will not buy another;I have posted when I first bought this car. Mostly all positive. Still a good car, but I will not buy another. I drive hard (80 to 85 mph) on the highway as my commute is 70 miles round trip to work. My mileage is average 28 mpg which is ok. Things that disappoint me.. 1-a/c in glovebox, but no light. 2-can not open drivers door and lock from inside (without key). 3-can not sit in the dark with only radio lights on. All lights including bright driving lights will be on. 4-hatch lock locks on its own free will (when your not ready) 5-outlet and mp3 jack in glovebox (useless location) 6-no quick release to let seat down. The twist knob is poor choice, as I like to lean back. 7-expensive maintenance.;Quick, agile. This car gets up goes at any speed even at 75 mph. Cruise control is perfect (I gave this a negative in my first review). Nice interior lighting. Beautiful exterior lines. 8 airbags. Good sounding stereo.;volkswagen_rabbit
03/23/2008;Coder157;Overall I enjoy my VW Rabbit. I love driving it. The only thing I dislike about it is its gas mileage. ;Heated seats, easy entry to hatchback, fold down backseat for extra space. ;volkswagen_rabbit
03/15/2008;4dr Hatchback;The sticker fuel consumption states 22 city 30 highway. My average city has not been more than 20 and highway not more than 22. I am very disappointed in the fuel consumption of this vehicle. Is there anything I can do? The dealer has no suggestions.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
03/07/2008;Harley;For some reason (maybe reading a lot of hype) I was focused on the Mazda3. Well, forget about it! My 2007 Rabbit 2dr. is superior in EVERY way, except gas mileage. That's fine with me. Do not buy any Mazda3 until you drive the comparable Rabbit, now made in Germany. Compared to everything else in its class, the Rabbit sets the standard, no matter what you read or hear elsewhere. It is a great car for those of us who enjoy driving.;5 cyl engine, 6 speed auto trans with 3 shift options, brakes, suspension, seats (mine are not heated), looks, upscale interior, hatchback utility, price (value), 4 year warranty, solid feel & famous German quality engineering.;volkswagen_rabbit
01/31/2008;dave farviknugen;For sure will get speeding tickets cause its way fun, surprised haven't been stopped. Yet. Should be the best selling car in America. Canoes and kayaks fit fine on roof rack. Lots of stuff in back. Back seat is better than previous years VWs. Did I say this is fun? ;Made in Deutschland. Not a thing wrong. Electronic stability option thing is fantastic. Great car in snow-can't hardly spinout, fine in crosswinds. Those north-central Europeans are so smart. Can put at least 4 bicycles in back by just taking off front wheel. Looks fast. Roars when floored.;volkswagen_rabbit
01/19/2008;savxms;I've had the rabbit for just about a year and it has been awesome. Everything about the car is great. Have not had any problems and made a trip a long road trip and the ride was very comfortable and smooth. definitely prefer this car.;turning signals on mirrors, ipod input, cruise control, heated mirrors, awesome handling;volkswagen_rabbit
01/09/2008;neil;"I bought an '07 4-door right off the showroom floor, black with the 17"" V-Vision wheels (I was hooked). This is my third VW, and the other two ('78 Rabbit, '88 Fox) were bulletproof. I compared the Mazda3, and the Rabbit offers far more features, refinement, and power (the 2.5L has terrific torque) for the money. Since October 2006, I've put 20,000 miles on it (18,000 miles in the first year). It feels like a budget Audi. What sinks it are the rattles (see Suggested Improvements). I've had it to the dealer once"; whatever they did only muted the rattles a little bit for a little while. No new car should rattle this much. I've had numerous Fords (no paragons of quality) that were far quieter.;volkswagen_rabbit
12/31/2007;Groot;I bought one of these for my wife a year ago and we are getting rid of it with under 17,000 miles on it. We are still upside down in the vehicle, and it is spending more time at the dealership than at our house. And for some reason the dealership is putting around 200 miles on it while trying to fix a problem with the idling. The vehicle has been a problem since the month after we got it and our dealership seems to be making little if no effort to fix the problem.;Gas mileage, base model has lots of nice features (window defrosters, turn signals on mirrors, display, safety features).;volkswagen_rabbit
12/06/2007;VWGryph24;I give it an excellent rating! Man that Mark 5 Rabbit is such a zippy car. It may not be as powerful as its big brother, the GTI, but it has plenty of spunk. In Sport mode its even more zippy! ;Sport mode, iPod adapter in the center armrest. Gotta love the VW logo in the back of the car. The 2.5 engine whine! ;volkswagen_rabbit
12/05/2007;JTC;I bought my 07 Rabbit 2dr in July and the car is incredibly comfortable, roomy, the engine is incredibly powerful and the overall quality is impressive. I test drove the Mazda3 Honda civic, and Scion and the Rabbit's engineering and quality are definitely outstanding compared to it's competitors. At 2000 miles I have had no problems whatsoever and I thoroughly enjoy driving it. Definitely best car purchase I've made in a while.;Superior quality, electro-magnetic power steering (awesome), powerful engine, comfort, basically everything.;volkswagen_rabbit
11/12/2007;SBC;Initially, I was drawn to the Rabbit coupe's styling, but its performance has been what's impressed me most since leasing it. In 'Drive' mode, it's gutsy, in a small car kind of way, but in 'Sport' mode, it's a different car! I've had cars with 'Sport' modes before and have noticed little difference. When I put the Rabbit in 'Sport' mode, its performance is similar to the Honda S2000 I used to drive, with better low end torque than the S2000. I have kept up with Porsches off the line in 'Sport' mode, granted they could roast the Rabbit over the long haul, but the point was to see if the Rabbit was a gamer. It is up for any challenge. Good, and powerful, things come in small packages!;Obviously, 'Sport' and shiftable mode, lane change turn signal, iPod adapter and center arm rest, the gauge and control lights, the VW emblem hatchback lock is clever, and finally, the very best feature, its low price and low lease payments for a bunch of driving fun!;volkswagen_rabbit
11/08/2007;Steve;Highs: torquey engine, great interior design, amazing spec list standard, cost of ownership is very low. Gas mileage is pretty poor, but if you're concerned about gas mileage you're probably not even going to be considering this car anyway. The 170 ft-lbs of torque is apparent from very low in the rev range, and worth the trade with gas mileage as far as I'm concerned. When compared to everything else $20k or less, the Rabbit shines through.;The 5-cyl sounds fantastic and is definitely a defining characteristic that sets the Rabbit apart from the rest of the crowd at that price.;volkswagen_rabbit
11/02/2007;2intwenty;This review is an update from my initial review 2/1/07. I now have 14,000 miles on the car and still like it. I was concerned about engine noise at first, but this seemed to lessen with the break-in. I like the growl! A few issues: on a couple occasions I've stalled after being in my heated office garage and then driving 5 mins in 40-50 degree temp. outside - stalled 2dif. times - exact same location each time. I have a rattle in the right vent. The driver's side window switches are peeling but dealer is replacing. My upper strut towers/bearing were replaced proactively by my dealer after I mentioned a slight steering noise - this fixed it. ;Design - just a really clean interior and exterior. Seats - very comfortable for me. Engine/handling. Drives great!!;volkswagen_rabbit
10/14/2007;frankenstrat;The gas mileage seems great (I average 37-40 mph highway), get up and go is great, love how it handles in rain and snow (with the exception of the wipers pushing water back onto the windshield). If it does rain, you must keep your windows closed or it pours inside. Within 6 months I began having problems with the front end - always seemed like something was rubbing and steering was not as tight. Well after 5 trips to the dealer they replaced the strut mounts, worked for about 2 weeks. After two more trips to the dealer, they are basically replacing the front end - not a good sign after one year.;Heated outside mirrors, cool dashboard, cruise control.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/08/2007;Cdog64;I've had the Rabbit for 1600 miles and have enjoyed the drive. The fit of the car is good. The perfomance is great. The comfort is good. The 2.5 with the auto is a fantastic match. I have had plenty of go when needed. You have to watch your speed til you get used to the ride at speed (you'll be doing 80 before you realize it). The Rabbit's handling is very responsive with good road feel. When the weather is bad there is no problem either. The sound system is very good and easy to set up. I'm 6'2 and 250 and fit in the seats comfortably. The car has more room than you think. All in all I have enjoyed this car a lot and find myself smiling when driving. Drive it and compare.;The 5cyl with the auto 6sp.;volkswagen_rabbit
09/05/2007;Liz Wolf;I have driven many cars in my 50 years; my Rabbit tops them all! Zip, zip, zippedy zip, in and out of parking spaces, in and out of traffic in a jiffy. Rabbit loves curves. One day I will get a traffic ticket for speeding, since Rabbit does not want to go slow or follow anyone and I just can't control it. Maybe Cesar Millan can help make it calm and assertive, not mildly aggressive :);volkswagen_rabbit
08/31/2007;garyeaston;"I test drove other cars in the same class (Corolla, Civic, etc.). Boy, are those cars ""Mom and Pop"" compared to the Rabbit! Let's start with the car's performance - it is simply hard to drive this car ""normally"", especially with the shiftable auto trans and Sport Mode! If I drive it fast and hard, gas mileage stays to the low end of what the sticker says (22), no big deal. If I drive ""normally"", I get 25 city/30 hwy MPG consistently. The car is incredibly fun to drive and has tight build quality. This is my second VW (Passat previously). Very happy with the car.";Performance, build quality, handling, safety, seat comfort.;volkswagen_rabbit
08/26/2007;pepo;I just purchased the Rabbit and I love it. It's my first VW and my first german car. Before this I had a Integra GS-R and I get the same if not better gas mileage in my Rabbit. This car has more torque than that car so it gets up and goes right away.;The iPod player. It sounds great I had one that you had to plug in the lighter and find a radio station it sounded like crap. Now it sounds great in the car.;volkswagen_rabbit
08/21/2007;emseearr;Very briefly, I've owned this car for two weeks and I am very happy with it so far. This is my second car, a big step up from my first, a 2003 Hyundai Elantra sedan. Overall, I feel this is a very well-designed and well-engineered car with some quirks, endearing and otherwise. I think it's style, performance and overall charming character more than make up for its few, unfortunate, shortcomings. ;The car is full of features that suggest real thought went into its design. The lane-changer signal, a/c diffuser vent and auto-opening windows are welcome features in this class. It's engine is gutsy, not uncommon for $17k, but its pep comes with atypical poise. It is simply fun to drive.;volkswagen_rabbit
08/15/2007;Jason Reid;This is my second VW. Now after I sold my first Golf I missed that car for over 5 years so it was apparent that i would buy another VW when I could. The car rides and handles great but my buddy gets better fuel mileage in his 2002 Toyota 4Runner. My Rabbit has stalled 9 times since ownership after a cold start in the middle of a busy highway, tell me that's safe. VW says that it's not throwing any codes and it seems to be working fine. Oh yeah it also has an automatic transmission, go figure. Yesterday I test drove a Nissan Versa which had more interior space but 28 less horsepower which I didn't even notice and better gas mileage. Just stay away from this car.;Tap turn signal for lane change. Tiptronic transmission.;volkswagen_rabbit
08/12/2007;J. Hall;First of all, let me start by saying how much I love this car! People have complained about fuel economy, but you have to realize it is a 5 cylinder engine! It is right in line with other 5s. Just look at the Volvo 5cyl and you find the same gas mpg rating! If you're coming from an SUV you're likely to love the mpg, but if not, you'll be somewhat disappointed, but you get the extra cylinder and it makes a big difference! There is nothing really bad about this car other than you will want to drive it fast which may cause you grief! It does seem to get a lot of attention and impresses everyone who sits in it! It's a step up in class from Honda! ;Heated seats, iPod dock, console, heated mirrors, drive quality, build, German engineering. It really is a car that feels like a luxury hatch! Especially when compared to other hatches in this price range!;volkswagen_rabbit
08/08/2007;Musikfaery;"I got my Rabbit a few months ago and absolutely LOVE it! My family has always driven Volkswagens and I'm no exception. It has great torque, super spacious insides for a two door, and it ultra sleek in design on the outside as well as in. My boyfriend is 6'2"" and fits in the passenger seat comfortably, where as on the opposite spectrum, I am 5'4"" and the seat and wheel adjust well for smaller build too. Recently took it on a 1,000 mile road trip and loved every minute of it! Great storage in the hatch, and all the options are wonderful, specially the mp3 hookup in the arm rest. The sparkly blue paint is great, and didn't cost a cent extra. Absolutely love my Thumper!!";Sound system radio and mp3. It's surprisingly good quality speakers. And having not only the iPod dock, but the ability to read mp3 cds allows for hours of music with little extra need of storage for cds, etc. The hatch and cover are also GREAT!;volkswagen_rabbit
08/07/2007;Ben;My experience so far has been great. The Rabbit is fun to drive in all settings I have encountered. The gas mileage is less than stated but comes in at estimates at about 60 mph. Oh and the 10 speaker stereo is great! Just be ready for high service costs. Even an oil change is about $50.00.;Interior lights, stereo. The attention to detail on the outside. I like the coating that is on the very lowest painted panel, seems very tough and is nearly unnoticeable. Heated seats are great on cold mornings too.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/30/2007;Jorge Provenzali;I learn to drive in a 1954 bug and owned 1995 Golf that was a great car. The end of my VW loving history came with my purchase 10 months ago of a 2007 Rabbit. The car is a nightmare, the fuel consumption equal that of a midsize SUV and the repertoire of sounds and noises has only improved with time (the comment I got at the dealership was, if I thought I had bought a Bentley). In any case, my major complaint is with the clutch, at the dealership they maintain that there is no possibility of adjustment as some genius devised a self adjusting system that can not be altered in any way. So the fun that used to be driving a manual transmission has turn into dreadful event with this car. ;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
07/29/2007;Andrew;"I had never driven a VW two weeks ago. After the test drive, I was sold. Build quality is amazing. Driving it is a joy. The 2.5 PZEV 5M is no slouch. Much more than ""acceptable,"" well beyond ""competent."" Not a racecar, but great torque, and amazing responsiveness in all the conditions its been through so far. For the price, I would say that my Rabbit is an amazing blend of performance, comfort, and quality. I can't even describe the feeling one gets while driving it. During the test drive, I just wanted to laugh maniacally. On paper, it doesn't look like much of an edge over the Versa, Yaris, Fit, or tC, other than performance. In person, it feels like a whole new class of vehicle.";Standard feature list is better than competition. Comfort and build quality, road feel (can't stress this enough!). Stock performance satisfying. PZEV makes me feel better about getting such mediocre gas mileage. Utility of the hatch is awesome.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/26/2007;MisterB;I bought my Rabbit at the end of the MY, and having driven it for 2000+ miles so far, I find that it's an amazing car. Responsive, nimble, roomy, and stylish. I can't say enough good things about this car. If I had to buy a car all over again, this would be the car. ;My number one favorite feature is the engine. A 2.5L inline 5 cylinder. It's got plenty of torque for the size of the car, which makes it quick little hopper. The storage space, intuitive controls, and convenience features really sold me on the rest of the car.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/23/2007;Fossa;"Very nice car loaded with features. I just wish the 2.5 engine had a better performance overall. It could be quicker and more fuel efficient. However the car is still a lot of fun to drive. Put some 18""s on it and it will be the best looking hatchback around. ";Trunk opener, interior design, turn signals. ;volkswagen_rabbit
07/20/2007;BP;Everything about this car is positive. The interior is great, the exterior is nice, and the engine is peppy.the interior is very good build quality, perhaps even upscale. The sunroof works great. Some say that it gets bad MPG, but in the real world, it only gets about 2-3 mpg less than those Japanese models that sacrifice everything to get 28 mpg in the city (real world, EPA for 2007 has been known to be inaccurate). Depending on the day, I get from 24-26 mpg in the city, and 27-32 mpg on the highway. I would rather drive a comfortable, safe, great handling, and good looking car than one that is small, uncomfortable, and one that has lackluster handling.;A sunroof, power everything, awesome interior, and great handling for the same price as the competitors. The six speed transmission is also much better than the old 4 speeds that they use.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/20/2007;jm;I test drove all of the subcompacts that are available. I test drove them all, and came down to the conclusion that I would rather have an inexpensive car with a 6 (not 4) speed transmission, an upscale interior, a more powerful engine that can actually pass on the highway, more interior space, more comfortable seats, and better handling. This car is also much, much safer than the other competitors, especially with all of the massive SUVs out there now. We have had absolutely no problems with this car after almost 5000 miles! I would definitely buy another! My wife likes mine so much that she is going to take mine and I am going to trade in her 2005 civic for a 2008 rabbit 4dr automatic. ;Handling, SAFETY, upscale interior for the price, power everything for lower than what the other guys charge, 6 speed transmission.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/09/2007;Henry;This car is an absolute dream! I've driven it every day for 8 months now and I still have a smile on my face! This thing is so fun to drive. When I was shopping, I looked at Scion tC, Nissan Sentra, Honda Fit, Dodge Caliber and none of them compare with the VW's power, safety, and standard features! Everything is included in the price! Only small negative I can find is the gas mileage. It could be better but you always have to make a trade-off. I'd rather have more power and gas mileage isn't too bad. I've been averaging 22 mi/gal. 90% city driving agressively. If you're in the market for this, I would wait for the '08 model which will have 170 horses and other improvements!;Tiptronic auto stick transmission. Sport mode. Cool red and blue instrument lights.;volkswagen_rabbit
07/08/2007;goof;This is my sixth and last VW. I am very disappointed! The suspension is extremely stiff, jarring, and very jittery. It is impossible to find any comfortable settings for the thinly padded drivers seat. Driving 300 inner-city miles a week is causing me hip and back pain! The electronic throttle programming doesn't seem compatible with the manual transmission. i.e. hard to engage the clutch smoothly. I have driven manual transmissions for 27 years and never stalled so much. I never experienced these issues with the last five VWs I have owned. Since almost all VWs are now based on the Golf V, I am now shopping for a non VW replacement.;"I love all the standard features: heated seats, six disc player in the stereo, airbags, ABS brakes. I opted for the sunroof and 16"" wheels.";volkswagen_rabbit
07/02/2007;DrJohnston;The Rabbit is a great car! It handles very well, but is still fairly compliant on the rough streets of cleveland. The automatic is great. I love the three settings (D,S,Tipi). The shifts are a little slow, but not bad for a slush box. Inside the car is great except for the lack of a center arm rest. The stereo sounds very crisp! Out of the comparable cars, Honda Fit, Scions, Civics, and such, I found this to be the best car on the market.;This has to be the only car in this segment that makes usable torque! Stereo is incredible! Great transmission! Great quality.;volkswagen_rabbit
06/29/2007;sisterearth;This car has a lot of pep to it! Passing is no problem, keeping it under the speed limit may be! I like the design, the interior is very comfortable. Good space even in the backseat, folded down my large dog stretches out nicely. Lots of cup holders, spots to put stuff, good air conditioner!;Groovy dash lighting, pretty good stock stereo, nice turn signals on mirrors, lots of seat adjustments, many places to put drinks, cool cooled glove box, sweet extra shifting feature, nice that it shows outside temps.;volkswagen_rabbit
06/28/2007;alf;Buying this car was the best decision I ever made! I've had it almost a year now, and I anticipate driving it at least 20,000 miles. Every time I get in my Rabbit, I feel good. I love everything about the car. The design, the power it gives me behind the wheel. ;I have to say, I honestly LOVE everything about it, but my favorite thing would be the back hatch that opens by pressing in the VW symbol. It's a really neat way to do it, instead of having an extra latch to pull.;volkswagen_rabbit
06/25/2007;atomicbri;Wow. I am really liking my new VW Rabbit. It's still a Golf in my head and I have to get used to the name. Otherwise this car is excellent! Already have taken it on a trip and it proves to be a great driver. Very quiet at highway speed with auto. Small so easy to parallel park in the city, but loads of cargo room. Fun to drive, handles well. And interior fit and finish is excellent.;Love the 6 speed auto!;volkswagen_rabbit
06/13/2007;shawn;"I am completely satisfied with my choice of the VW auto. This car feels and rides just as awesome as it looks. Great passing power, even at 70 mph. Handles the local twisties with pleasant agility. I bought mine with the ground effects and it is worth the money, looks really cool and sporty. I also upgraded to 16"" wheels for better ride. Just remember this changes the speedometer accuracy. I can't figure out how to sit inside with the interior dash lights on, without the driving lights blinding away at the same time (kind of irritating). Also it seems there is no glovebox light. Cruise control on the blinkers is less than desirable. The seat adjustments are poorly designed. I recommend this car. ";Cool interior lights. Rear split folding seats. Telescopic tilt wheel. Dash indicator tells exact maintenance times. Outside temp. 6 airbags, 2 optional, 8 total. 10 speakers standard. MP3. Ambience lights shine on console. Tranny has econo, sport and semi-auto modes. Beautiful exterior lines.;volkswagen_rabbit
06/13/2007;melissa;Well I guess I have to say that I will never own anything other than a VW, so I am a little biased, but my new Rabbit is awesome. I just love it. The only downside is that they don't come as a diesel or have a good input plug for an iPod. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a great car for a low cost. ;The design. I have a lot of room inside, but also can park in small spaces. It is great for the city. ;volkswagen_rabbit

06/05/2007;the king;The car definitely out shines all other cars in this price range. Performance is the name of the game on the highway. Most cars today lack handling features that are standard on the Rabbit. I test drove the competitors with fuel efficiency atop my requirements. After driving the 30+ mi/gal cars I started noticing a trend toward thinning out the suspension to ensure fluidity of movement. The difference with these fuel efficient cars and the Rabbit is severe. The Rabbit feels solid and grounded where its competitors want to go flying. A majority of my driving occurs on LA's horribly unkept roads with major obstacles every 100 yards including poor drivers with cellphones. I must be nimble.;Headroom, rear passenger space, one-touch windows, auto trans with sport mode, 16 alloys, rear lift gate latch, center a/c vent, a/c vent into glove box, front wheel drive, Rear seats 60/40 split is very easy to put down and up.

I upgraded from 15 stock wheels to 16 inch alloy mag wheels, much better ride. Make sure you get ASR and stability control. 6 speed automatic tiptronic transmission is really cool! Seats are a little budget, but the car stops on a dime! Handles great!! Gas mileage is not too bad. Safety cage of vehicle is like one you would get on 35k or more vehicle. Transmission is a little tight between 20 mph and 40 mph, after that it takes off! Road noise not bad.

Solid weight to the car.;volkswagen_rabbit
05/16/2007;tacalin;Bad points that I found up until now: Seats too rigid. In a trip Montreal ? Toronto (about 500 Km) it is really difficult to be comfortable. Auto-volume control makes the lower frequency go very high if I brake. Making this option OFF solve the problem. Too much gas consumption in town, about 18.1 miles for a gallon, or 13 liters for 100 Km. On the highway, it was about 23.52 miles for a gallon, or 10 liters for 100 Km. - A constant difference of 5 Km/h between the speedometer and a GPS (at 55 real, it shows 50, at 125 it shows 120). The same GPS gadget was used on several Americans and Japanese cars and the error was about 1 Km/h, more or less.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
05/04/2007;Jen;I thought I was buying a better quality car. I was wrong. The paint is chipping in a few spots and there are lines throughout the paint that won't come out even after washing, waxing and buffing. Also there are three rattles inside that the dealership can't seem to fix. When accelerating you pick up speed until it hits 4000 rpms then it just stops accelerating.

I looked at a Yaris, Civic, Fit, Corolla and was debating until my dad called me up and said I should test drive a Rabbit before making my decision. This car sold itself to me. I test drove it, pronounced this was the car I was getting and bought it! All my friends are jealous... in 3 weeks I've gone from 17 miles to mid 700 miles and it still makes me very happy. I was looking for a 2 door manual transmission that made driving fun. I found it and more with everything it comes with.

I feel like I am driving a $35k luxury car! Very tight body, good vision, and great German engineering (attention to detail). The car seems well planted to the ground. You do sacrifice some fuel economy, but in return, get a very safe and stable vehicle that comes in a small package. I am very impressed with this vehicle and the many features that come standard on this car. I am on my 4th day of ownership. Everything seems to be screwed together well. I cannot comment on the reliability of my new Rabbit.;Seating is excellent. A/C is as good as I have ever experienced. Like the six speed automatic and spunky 5cyl motor.

04/01/2007;Shaun;Just got the rabbit yesterday, I did a lot of research into this and other models (i.e., toyota corolla, yaris, civic, mazda3) and found this to be the most impressive out of them. I have always owned japanese, mainly toyota, and when I drove this car, I was impressed with how much more solid, and responsive it felt. I didn't feel like I was driving a heap of recycled beer cans, and it has amazing get up and go due to the 170lb/ft of torque. I would recommend this car to anyone that seriously enjoys feeling safe, and enjoying a quiet ride, without wanting to spend a ton of cash. You will not be disappointed!;Red/blue dash/led lights, blinkers on side mirrors, the car itself is amazing. ;volkswagen_rabbit
03/26/2007;S. A. Sherman;Near luxury quality interior and build. Fun to drive. Good city car. No problems to date. Fine economical transport.;Sporty quality with manual shifter.;volkswagen_rabbit
03/25/2007;KC SLY;"The car is loaded with stock features. Options for once are just for personalization instead of need (traction contral, integrated turn signals in the mirrors,t elescopic wheel). I am 6' 2"" and fit in the front and in the back. My other car is a Mercedes as is my girlfriend's, and we both are amazed at what we got for the money. ";"Stock stereo rocks. The car is so quiet the first few times I stopped I had to check the tach to see if the car was still running. 5 cyl engine puts competitors to shame. I can leave it in 4th in town all day, very torquey. 16"" alloys only cost $400 extra. The interior screams expensive. ";volkswagen_rabbit
03/21/2007;troy;We have been looking into getting a new car for a while now and we were blown away by the Rabbit. The look of the interior and exterior are great and it has way more standard features than expected. There are so many little features and neat things about this car that I feel like a salesperson every time I tell someone about it! The ride is comfortable and smooth for a car its size. It has a ton of room inside to fit four people comfortably. It handles really nicely and has a lot of power. It shifts really smoothly and quickly for being an automatic and the Tiptronic is fun to have (even though I don't really use it all that often). Seriously, this is an incredibly fun car to drive!;Everything! It has too many features to list! My favorite is probably the interior design and the great amount of power from the 5-cylinder engine. If I need to pass someone, it's almost instantly. When accelerating on the highway, there's plenty of power. You feel it pull you into your seat.;volkswagen_rabbit
03/19/2007;sruczko;I knew I was going to buy this car as soon as I sat in it at a recent auto show. So far, I have not regretted trading my 2004 Element for this fun to drive and feature laden hatchback. It has an excellent Teutonic design inside and out, and it has every feature you really need for your daily drive. It has top notch build quality. It is an Audi for the masses.;The instrument layout and illumination, blinker mirrors, key, under hood layout, torque and Tiptronic operation, and the interior design.;volkswagen_rabbit
02/26/2007;ralfo;"The Rabbit is a great car in this price range. I drove some of the Japanese imports and this car beats them all as far as power, handling and ride are concerned. It's very solid and well planted as most German cars are. It's not ""tinny."" For the options you get, the price is right! I bought this car as a commuter car and have not been disappointed. It fits you like a glove when you drive it! Some are complaining about the gas mileage...but you can't compare it to Civics, Mazda3s, and the Yaris...etc as the horsepower and torque blow those all away. They are not in same class! You want to drive a lawnmower....then buy a Yaris or Fit!";The looks, handling, ride, safety features, standard items such as CD/MP3 changer, heated seats and much more!;volkswagen_rabbit
02/24/2007;j mar;The 2007 Volkswagen Rabbit is a wonderful and surprisingly quick, fun to drive car. I couldn't be happier with it.;volkswagen_rabbit;volkswagen_rabbit
02/23/2007;Lori;I've always driven old Volvos, but last year after spending a month in Munich I became a fan of German engineering. I have not been disappointed in my new Rabbit. I am in LOVE. It hugs the road and scoots around like a high performance sports car! Everyone that drives it adores it. It fits like a glove when driving. It's a real drivers' car. It great in the snowy Vermont winters (get Nokian tires).;It is quick and tight in the corners. It handles like a charm.;volkswagen_rabbit

02/20/2007;Michael Berry;I bought an '07 Rabbit in Oct. '06. The car was great for the first 500 miles, after that a rattle started coming from the vents. I took it to the dealer and they said that the rattle was normal, they would glue the vents, but never fixed the problem. My model had the sunroof, the area with the controls would rattle. I took it to the dealer again and they never fixed it. The seat belts would rattle. The rear seat, drivers left was built in the factory with a latch that was to big. It would make a popping sound that drove me nuts. I took it to the dealer and they had my car for three days before telling me that they couldn't fix it. After about 2,000 miles, the fan blower would make random grinding noise. The moonroof would rattle and it makes a weird noise inside the car at 25-35 mph. ;I love the 2.5L engine. The car was fun in sport mode.;volkswagen_rabbit
02/16/2007;bwian;From the moment I bought my Rabbit, I was smitten. The 2.5 liter engine growls a bit when you step on it (which i like), but otherwise is very quiet and responsive, even in 5th gear on the freeway. The seats are firm but comfy and the dash is laid out nicely. The red-on-violet instrument cluster is complemented nicely by the soft red interior lighting...quite sexy. I didn't think the one-tap lane-change feature was such a big deal until I used it. One tap and the turn signal blinks three times without having to hold it, nice. I whittled my original list of 12 cars down to 5 and then test drove them all. The Rabbit beat them all out in the price-to-value category, big time.;The red-on-violet instrument cluster, the 2.5 liter engine, the one-tap lane-change feature, the soft red nighttime interior lighting, the short throw gearbox, the interior and exterior lighting.;volkswagen_rabbit
02/16/2007;gumpyoldman;I test drove a Fit, a Civic, Corolla, Matrix, Mazda3 and a Versa. The Rabbit was by far the most impressive of the bunch. I never though I'd own another VW but the Rabbit was far and away the better driving car so one is now in my driveway. Its gas mileage is better than I had expected and it handles really well. It is a great little snow car too!;It has tons of power. The interior is a step above the competition.;volkswagen_rabbit
01/20/2009;mercuryct;Supremely comfortable as far as its seats go, 2.4 provides adequate power, feels very safe, understated looks. Its quirks can be very annoying, however. Chief among them are counterintuitive and slow-acting power door locks, needlessly complicated radio and climate controls, inadequate sun visors, unlit power-seat memory buttons. Not especially quiet in terms of engine noise. Fit and finish adequate but perhaps less than I expected. The dash trim is apparently real wood but finished to look cheaper than the plastic on my old Subaru. And might I add that tire-pressure sensors are a nightmare.;Comfort, size, sense of safety, classic looks.;volvo_v70
06/14/2008;Otoman;This has been a fantastic car. Very comfortable for the long haul with outstanding seats, lots of cargo room and best of all, it flies! No one expects that a Volvo wagon can move so quickly. I often have cars trying to pass me on the right/cut me off, etc. I can easily close down any hole in the traffic with this car. Passing/merging is fun. Blitzing down interstate on-ramps is a joy. Clover leaf on-ramps are a treat as well. The upgraded sound system is worth the money. If you want a lot of go with very little show, this is your car. ;High pressure turbo, Different suspension settings with a push of a button, seats, handling, Brembo brakes.;volvo_v70
05/03/2008;Moi;Great on the open road and mileage has been great city 25 highway 31 MPG. Handles better than my prior bmw even though it is a station wagon. Great for long trips and needing extra space. Too bad the 2008's are being redesigned and don't hold up against the 2007 V70;Handling, fuel economy, radio, space, comfort;volvo_v70
03/03/2008;Dave - LA;I have been wanting to purchase a V70 or XC70 for a few years. I swapped my Toyota 4Runner due to gas mileage for the V70. The Volvo drives and sounds a lot like my Honda Accord that I had 12 years ago! I love that Honda and I love the way this car drives. I will be using the car for surfing, so I opted for the optional roof racks which do produce some wind noise. The biggest suprise is the performance. I have owned 3 porsches and I currently own a 911. I must say the Volvo's pick up is excellent, and I can really feel the turbo's kick. I am very pleased with the car so far, and I hope to keep it for at least 8-10 years! ;Booster seats, leather, performance, exterior styling, usability and visibility. ;volvo_v70
11/04/2007;Carl Moore Houston;I bought a 2007 V70 closeout which came with lots of options as a replacement for my wife's 940 which was totaled in a wreck -- great deal . The car is very comfortable driving and handling. The 2.5T has excellent pickup compared with the older B230F engine. Gas mileage is good -- approx 22 mpg around town. ;Styling. I like the battery and fuses in trunk as a safety improvement. The dual temp control is a nice feature since different folks like different temps. The additional 12v outlets and 6 cup holders is great. The 3 person memory electric seat is a plus. Tire pressue monitoring is excellent idea.;volvo_v70
09/05/2007;volvo bill;Great design for short people;Visibility and safety.;volvo_v70
05/03/2007;Michael;V2.4L provides enough power for daily use. Ride is quiet and steering provides excellent handling. Excellent suspension. Good combination of engine and automatic transmission. Integrated child booster seat may not be comfortable for long distances since legs touch the edge of the seat. Leather interior will require a protective sheet for the baby seat.;Wagon concept and size of trunk. Controls and seats. Several safety features. ;volvo_v70
02/06/2007;RRB;Provides more usable space than most small SUVs while possessing better road manners and comfort. However, after having driven Saabs for many years, I found the large turning radius of this vehicle to be almost truck-like by comparison. ;Comfortable seats and reasonable performance.;volvo_v70
12/19/2006;J.A.A.;Great gas mileage and a great road trip vehicle for your rides to Grandma's house. The 2.4 L engine does not miss a step. It has more than enough pep to handle everyday driving.;volvo_v70;volvo_v70
11/04/2006;MHR26;I bought a similar version in 2001 and drove my Volvo for over 185,000 with no issues other than routine maintenance. The engineering is fantastic, fuel economy is good considering size and weight of the vehicle. Safety is fantastic and overall, best car I have ever bought.;Garage pass key holder, Windshield passholder and other smart features;volvo_v70
08/25/2006;White;What a nice car! Bought it for safety reputation. Handles well, is comfortable and holds road like it's glued. Too much wind noise and low beams cut off too short. Fit and finish is first rate and car is tight, excpept for wind noise. Gets less fuel economy than other mid-sized domestic cars, which was a surprise. Get 21-23 in town and 26-29 in hilly country, so I guess that's not too bad. Guess I'm getting old, but it has one tough oil filter for a shade tree mechanic! Plenty speedy with 2.5 turbo. The run flat tires had defective sensors that dealer service did not understand and were impossible to fix. Eventually replaced. I like the car alot! ;The optional top line stability control feature was big reason for purchase. The auto wipers that sense rain are nice. I got the home link system which is great for my gated community. Seats are very comfortable and adjust easily, as does steering column tilt and telescope.;volvo_v70
09/29/2009;haris chandra;While driving at speed of just 70 MPH both my mud flaps tore, broke and very expensive to replace.;;toyota_tacoma
06/09/2009;Robert C;First Toyota truck I've owned. I've owned a Frontier and a Ranger in the past. The Tacoma is a little better than the Frontier and a lot better than the Ranger, if you can get over the price difference. My Access Cab 4 cyl. is good on gas, but is underpowered even with a manual trans. First gear seems to be geared too low and hard to find at times when rolling at lower speeds. The exterior design is OK, with the stock wheels and tires too small for the well area The interior is nicely laid out with plenty of leg room for tall drivers. The radio is a little weak and the access cab area seating is too straight up for a comfortable ride. Overall, quality is good, just needs more 4cyl power.;Front cabin space especially for taller drivers. Composite bed liner with adjustable tie-downs.;toyota_tacoma
06/06/2009;cardude;I've had this truck for a little over two years now. Traded in a horrible piece of GM junk (2000 Pontiac firebird), needed a truck as I lived in a very rural area where trucks are a necessity. Reliability has been through the roof, especially compared to all of the GM cars and trucks that we have owned over the years. I went with the absolute base model with auto trans as the only option but fit and finish is still excellent along with a plethora of standard features. It doesn't even feel like a truck with the elegant but tough looking interior and almost car like handling. GM should've taken note long ago or they wouldn't be in such dire straits. Overall I am very pleased. ;Ext/Int design, 6 cup holders, 26mpg, lots of storage, paint quality, standard Air and CD player, handling, copious leg and head room, stain proof seats, absolutely no problems at 40K miles, excellent headlight visibility, engine is easy and simple to work on if you do your own servicing.;toyota_tacoma
06/05/2009;bgr;I bought this truck brand new over two years ago and I drive it for work every day. The Composite bed is a great feature as well as the power outlet in the bed. I didn't have a generator and it powered some basic items in my house for a couple days after a recent storm. The factory tires ride a little rough but have pretty good reliability. The stereo could be a little better. I love the design on the interior and exterior. Gas mileage is great. I usually average around 21-22 miles per gallon. Towing is ok but my 16' ski boat dogs it down a little. Unfortunately the bed dents easily like my last Tacoma. The front bumper should be chrome instead of plastic as well. ;Design, Bed, & Interior Comfort;toyota_tacoma
05/18/2009;AHDIAMOND;I had a Nissan Pathfinder that had a 3.5 litre and never got over 16 mpg. This Toyota gets 20 mpg with a 4.0 litre. I have a TRD package so the bilstein shocks help the ride when I pull my 24 foot boat. The limited slip diff works well on slippery ramps.;"sits up high, rides well, put 2009 17"" wheels on";toyota_tacoma
04/30/2009;MyTacoBites;"I'll start by saying that I've owned many Toyotas over the years and have been very satisfied with every one but this one. After 18k miles the engine began to knock loudly (piston wobble) and the tranny will kick after every stop (driveline lash). These traits all called ""normal"" by Toyota. These trucks do not represent the quality the brand has developed through the years. If you can live with a truck that makes a nasty knock at idle, shifts through the auto gearbox after a stop...only to thump you after finally finding first gear, chasing wheel balance due to the hub offset being whacked and always having steering wheel shimmy"; this might be the truck for you.;toyota_tacoma
02/07/2009;Jared;I bought this truck new. I am an artist and have a lot to move. I have moved 3 times using the truck and love it. The economy is good for a truck, especially on my long freeway drives. I was in an accident in the truck and was very safe. It is a wonderful truck;I love the access cab doors that fold out and the moving tie downs!;toyota_tacoma
02/06/2009;Ted;Only thing I would have to change is the paint. Drives like a charm, reliability and drivetrain performance is great. Overall really happy with the truck.;V-6 is a lot faster than I thought, controls great, lots of room.;toyota_tacoma
01/23/2009;Dave;It's a jack of all trades vehicle. Plenty of room for the kids. Hauls all my stuff. Decent mileage for commuting. Has a somewhat bouncy ride but it's a truck and truth be told does ride better than most other trucks I have ridden in. Has really light and easy steering. Real easy to drive. The transmission is a dream. Smooth shifting and usually grabs just the right gear. You can slap the stick for quick acceleration. Tows my boat very easily.;Reliability and drivetrain performance.;toyota_tacoma
12/16/2008;Mike;Overall it's a nice truck. Very comfortable, good power and lots of features. The stock suspension would bottom out with a load (400 lb motorcycle in the bed) but there is a service bulletin out to upgrade the suspension if you actually use it as a truck. Gas mileage could be a little better. I average 16-17 MPG, mixed driving and topped out at 20.;Exterior styling, sliding rear window, bucket seats, behind the seat storage for rear seats, under-rail sliding tie- down system and traction control.;toyota_tacoma
02/08/2007;751;I got the 07 Tacoma and love it. It drives better than my Firebird I had before it. Only knock is the gas mileage is not what I expected it to be. Also cruise control takes some getting used to. I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone. You must get a cold air intake and magnaflow muffler installed. It improves gas mileage and power and makes a great engine perform even better. Plus it is easy to install and fairly cheap.;toyota_tacoma;toyota_tacoma
02/03/2007;Erik;Love this truck! The truck only has 320 miles on it, but it's been a joy to own so far. Lots of power, handles great, and comfortable. Rides better than my 02 Tacoma 4WD did.;4.0L V6, smooth shifting automatic, sport style seats.;toyota_tacoma
01/24/2007;crazyman;This truck is a very smooth ride, has plenty of power and is very comfortable on long trips. Visibility is great, you can see all around very well.The truck handles well at higher speeds when changing lanes and can be thrown around at lower speeds without feeling like your going to roll it over. The main thing wrong with this truck (mine anyway) is that at around 70 mph the front end seems to lift up and it loses stability and steering feel. A windy day and getting around some tractor trailers will make you have to really pay attention to what its doing. Strangely putting on more speed seems to improve this handleing defect. Seems to have a lot if wind noise coming off the outside mirrors.;Comfortable, roomy, powerful. I get 19.6 mph doing normal driving combined city and highway. Get about 16.5 driving on a trip when cruising at 80-85. Can get 21 if you baby it. ;toyota_tacoma
01/22/2007;CharlieX;Got the SR5 package. Only a couple days old, but this is a great great great vehicle. Drives great, wonderful design elements, and Toyota reliability. Compared to my girlfriend's 2006 Lexus IS250 - the Tacoma drives like the truck version: nimble and comfortable with a lift and bouncier shocks. Comfortable in heavy street and freeway traffic in LA. Everything feels solid and well put together. And something like 9 cup holders!;Responsive engine, drives like a luxury car turned truck, very comfortable interior, world class design all around. Plenty of behind/below seat compartments for tools and whatnot... even came with a flashlight holder for my Maglite. Included cleats in bed rails are a nice touch. ;toyota_tacoma
01/22/2007;Ray;After having owned several toyotas in the past I'm somewhat disappointed. 1) Idle indictates only around 600 rpm;" however vehicle lunges and you find yourself ""riding"" the brakes. This is especially uneasy in stop and go traffic. 2) Brakes have a ""spongy feel"" and require a lot brake pedal force. 3) When driving with hand on the automatic transmission shift lever, centrifugal force when making a right turn will cause the shift lever to move from the ""D"" (drive) to ""4"" (gear) automatically. 4) Seat position is too low. No adjustment. 5) Steering wheel radio controls designed top/bottom (together) rather than left/right (separated). This causes you to take your eyes of road to use controls. ";toyota_tacoma
01/17/2007;hl;I have the truck for about 1500 miles. It has following problems: 1.) poor alignment: I have to re-align front wheels to drive straight. 2.) power steel failed with fluid leaked out. It has to be serviced and part changed. 3). rattle noise from right side of cab. It has not being fixed after two trips to dealership. ;Pro: good appearance, powerful as a V6, reasonable fuel economy.;toyota_tacoma
01/07/2007;ol dave;"Just purchased, but the test drive sold this vehicle. I was ready to buy the Frontier, a nicely-priced '07 ""mgr.'s special"" and decided I owed myself the test drive in the latest Taco. I have never owned either brand before. Traded a Sube, still have an old 318 Dakota. The Fronty was a good truck but this blew it away in my opinion. I greatly prefer the adult interior styling and the overall road feel. Power was excellent and felt more controlled in street conditions than brand N. A very sophisticated pickup truck. Did not want the fuel and complexity of 4WD, or cute lettering on the side, so took the straight 4x2 dbl cab with the l/b. Long bed rode better than the short.";The engine. The interior, control layout, and styling overall. Comfortable driver seating. Sliding rear window. Nice bedliner. Decent rear passenger room. Great ride and handling. ;toyota_tacoma
01/07/2007;JCO;Actually went to the dealer to purchase a RAV4 to replace the wife's older RAV4. She said she wanted to test drive the Tacoma, and the rest is history. We didn't see the need for the offroad model and are very satisfied with the truck. I think a big plus with the wife is sitting higher than a RAV. Visibility is great. it drives very smoothly and shifts beautifully too. ;The most power of any vehicle I have ever owned, visibility is great, radio controls on the steering wheel, true dual cab in size.;toyota_tacoma
12/31/2006;esteyskal;It doesn't have as much hp as the frontier or ridgeline. However it tows more, has a higher payload rating and accelerates better than both of them. All the while it gets better gas mileage. Off road it is tough yet comfortable. The tacoma is the best compact truck out there period. It is expensive. You certainly get the value for what you are paying however a frontier becomes much more lucrative when it is $7k less.;Limited slip differential. Power circuit in bed of truck. A bed that doesn't need a liner. The most body styles to choose from. ;toyota_tacoma
12/31/2006;J. Matthews;The drive and ride on this vehicle is very good. The transmission shifts good and is smooth in shifting. The brakes seem to be very responsive and firm. After the fact of purchase I found out that the plugs needed to be changed every 15000 miles. I really find that unacceptable. I changed them and restored the gas mileage back in the 18-20 mpg range. The Tacoma needs the timing chain changed out at 100000 miles. I find that unacceptable. I bought this vehicle for low maintenance costs. I don't think this will happen.;The ride, looks and comfort in the seats. There is room for four adults with comfort after adjusting the front seat.;toyota_tacoma
12/28/2006;Steve;I purchased a new new Tacoma PreRunner after testing a 2006 Tundra. I was pleasantly impressed with the Tacoma styling and the handling, particularly when compared to its big brother. My only disappointment (and it is minor at this time) is the mileage of the automatic being rated at 6 miles/gallon on the highway less than the 5 speed standard Tacoma version. ;I am particularly impressed with the worksmanship of the vehicle and the handling characteristics. Based on a couple other truck builders I investigated, the Tacoma won hands-down.;toyota_tacoma
12/26/2006;Tim;Its true, you get what you pay for. Every aspect of this truck is very near to perfect. Smooth, quick, quiet at hwy speeds, eye catching at every turn and just overall comfy. Be sure to test drive this truck prior to making your final purchase.;The hood scoop, the zig-zag auto trans shifter and the roominess of the interior. The Tacoma is a big mid-sized truck.;toyota_tacoma
12/22/2006;DoubleDecker;I've had this vehicle for one week. I replaced a 2004 model Tacoma Double Cab with this one. They finally moved the clock! Has more power, doesn't seem to take up more room in the garage, but feels larger. Brakes don't feel as mushy as the old style eiher.;I enjoy the power in this model, but I'd have to say the interior is my favorite with this model.;toyota_tacoma
12/20/2006;Steve;I thought my wife's 2001 Acura TL was quick but the engine of this Tacoma is impressive when power is necessary. Very fast! Rides like a truck which I enjoy but is still very smooth and comfortable to travel. Decent room for passengers in the rear although a little tight if you have tall people up front. Very nice interior although I've noticed a tendency to inadvertently push the steering wheel radio controls during turns. Overall a great looking and great performing truck. ;The engine. Smooth and responsive. Nice stereo although a little bassy even when adjusted to low. ;toyota_tacoma
12/19/2006;Captaincop;I looked around a lot before I bought my Tacoma. I had Chevys and GMCs, too! I had three Dodges. This is the best overall truck I have ever owned. The pickup of the v6 is great. My fuel economy is getting better (18.5) as of 1,000 mile mark. The quality of the paint, interior, all around looks is overwhelming compared to some other car company models. This Tacoma is nice to drive and comfortable too! It just looks good. Indigo Ink Blue! 6 CDs in radio is great. The sound of the radio is real quality.;I just hope Toyota doesn't change this truck too much, I may not want to ever trade it in.;toyota_tacoma
12/11/2006;Randy;The 07 Tacoma is rock solid. Toyota's 4.0L engine is amazingly powerfull. This truck rocks!! Get the upgraded sound system if you can swing it.;The handling performance with the sport package is awesome. I also like the engine power, body style and the reliability of the truck. I'm also pleased with the height of the truck!;toyota_tacoma
12/10/2006;GBinFL;Traded in a 2003 VW GTI for this truck, as we needed a more family-friendly vehicle. Bought with TRD Sport Pkg#1. Truck looks great, handles great, fun to drive. There are some minor design issues that would make a difference. Looks awesome with hood protector, stainless tube steps, and Lund tonneau cover. Love the 115v power outlet in the bed, but worried that composite bed material will scratch very easily. Need to find some carpet or something to line the bed with. Also wish you could get a factory sunroof in double cab models. Like any vehicle, not perfect, but pretty darn good, and hope the reliability is as good as our Sienna.;Great looks, especially in Silver Streak Mica with the hood scoop from the TRD package, and the Toyota hood protector... looks really sharp. Cabin comfortable, decent turning radius, good ride (but never lets you forget you're in a truck!) Like the offroad look on a 2WD truck.;toyota_tacoma

11/27/2006;Toyota Driver;Just switched from an 06 Tundra access cab to the Tacoma Double Cab. Aside from it being a double cab, the only size difference is the width.

All controls positioned almost perfectly.;toyota_tacoma
11/20/2006;Shawn;I'm hoping this truck will match my 1986 toyota pickup's reliability. I must say that so far the ride has been lots of fun! Better gas mileage than my s-10 zr2 and plenty of pep for a 4 cyl. The interior is a step above the colorado and ranger, the ride is much more refined as well. ;Manual transmission! 20 mpg which is awesome in a 4x4!;toyota_tacoma
11/14/2006;Dustin; I have experienced so far with my Tacoma that they have got everything the way that it should be. The truck runs like a sports car, and handles as well as anything I have driven.

Very comfortable inside. Fold down rear ""seatlets"" work great for holding ice chests for camping. On the down side: The rear end bottoms out easily under load. Can be remedied with add-a-leafs or air bags. Not much ground clearance, I may get a lift kit.I liked the old lever-type 4X4 range shifter better. New electronic dial type range selector works reliably, but not as smooth and predictably as an actual lever did. ";Power mirrors/doorlocks. Lumbar support. Single pane slider window works better than old dual panes. 400W power inverter works great when camping. Integrated fog lights are nice, a little upward adjustment helps for range. Diff lock's great. Oil filter and oil drain plug positions are wonderful!;toyota_tacoma
11/27/2008;John M.;I purchased a replacement for my 2001 Jeep Wrangler intending to do better than 12 mpg. The Toyota delivers about 18 mpg highway (thanks to the terrible new corn fuels that are terrible for the environment anyway) and 12 mpg city. After about 7 months of ownership, my check engine light came on. $6,500 worth of warranty work and 4 trips later, it is off. My dealer kindly loaned me a fully loaded Avalon to drive in the mean-time. I hate the plastic bed, but I'm certain the decreased weight saves on gas mileage. The looks are ok, I prefer 4th generation Tacomas (2001-2004) over the 5th. Paint chips like crazy on my silver model. The painted plastic bumpers, etc are a bad idea. ;"Best fuel mileage in class. Not a ""Big Three"" vehicle but made in the US. Very quiet interior and good comfort.";toyota_tacoma
11/26/2008;sunnybird;I have been driving this truck since new in Apr.'05 and I have encountered no reliability problems and have no complaints. Road trips are no problem, comfort is there, ride is nice. With mixed driving and my sometimes heavy foot I average 18-19 mpg. highway average with cruise set 70 to 75 mph I will average 19-21 mpg. I would recommend this truck with no question. ;Functionality of the bed. Roomy interior and nice power, good response from transmission. Also lots of storage compartments, very handy.;toyota_tacoma
09/22/2008;tacoman;Nice truck, with excellent off road capabilities. This truck will get you and your gear out and back without a problem. It can climb steep inclines, narrow enough to get through the trees, light enough to get over the mud, and a great turning radius for a truck. I've yet to get this truck stuck in the deserts of Utah or the mountains of Colorado. It's certainly not a luxury vehicle but comfortable and fits well.;Fun to drive, plenty of power, and fits in the garage.;toyota_tacoma
09/10/2008;Jim;"My best purchase ""ever"". Drive 80+ miles daily, and recently slowed down to 55 with the cruise control on. Best mpg so far is 26 mpg @ 55 mph! Usually, I'm @ 22-23 mpg, but I consistently drive under 60 mph. Recent valve rattle is a concern and I will check for technical service bulletins. Have not missed an oil change, and it cannot be ""normal"" for a new engine to rattle! Toyota can be tough, but be persistent and do not accept defects as ""normal"". I demanded an engine rebuild @ 108,000 miles on a Camry due to an oil sludge problem caused by an engine re-design in order to receive a higher EPA rating for the 2.4L engine. The dealer rebuilt the engine, but it took serious effort. ";Exterior fit and finish.;toyota_tacoma
09/09/2008;Trans. Rattle;Bought the reg. cab 4x4 for utility and reliability. The truck has lived up to my expectation except for the 5 spd manual trans. The trans. has rattled when in neutral since day one. Rattle is tolerable except when A/C compressor is running. Had dealer inspect, but they claim it is normal. If I wanted a truck that rattled I would have saved some money and not bought new. I would not buy this truck again do to this problem. If you are going to buy a Tacoma don't get the 5 spd. I haven't heard anything about the 6spd or auto. There is no point in spending extra money for a Toyota if they are going to build them like Fords in California.;Appearances;toyota_tacoma
08/03/2008;tslick76;I think the Toyota Tacoma V6 is great strong Motor and the 6 speed m/t works fine (I find the oil changes very easy to do, I love the location of the oil filter). But, I have had some problems with chipping paint also. Furthermore the seating position is a little low. Also no iPod connection, my company work van has one. Also I wish the Tacoma had pop out wing windows (my 2004 Tacoma did). The Tacoma has great looks and it will be easy to sale. I suggest getting the tow package (6500lbs), the Tacoma is strong and can handle towing and off road driving. Its easy to beat up any truck, but in 10 years this truck will be still on the road (reliable).;Looks, power being reliable and options are the main selling point to this truck. Also the bed is nice feature with power outlet and cubbie holes.;toyota_tacoma
07/16/2008;Kyle;I have owned my '07 Tacoma for a year now and it's the best vehicle purchase I've ever made! It has great power, towing and offroad capability. It is a fun truck to drive on and off road. On the road it drives very smooth. The seats are comfortable and the cab has more room than any other midsize truck that I can think of. It's also Toyota so I know it will last me ages! ;I love the utility bed with the 400w power adapter and the tie down points and the two storage areas. The TRD package is great with the bilstein shocks. I also love the look of the truck and the room. ;toyota_tacoma
06/25/2008;kjsayers;"This is my 2nd Tacoma and 4th Toyota. I knew this was the only truck I was going to buy the only thing was to decide a color (black). There is a lot of storage. The storage under and behind the rear seats is beyond great. The composite bed is much needed. Although it can be slick. The engine power is excellent and after 17K miles I get 21 hwy and 18 mixed driving. I have no complaints except the paint scratches very easy. Toyota needs to address this along with the 17"" sport wheels that have a pitting problem in the finish.";MPG, storage, versitility, ride.;toyota_tacoma
06/21/2008;Ray Rounds;I love my Tacoma; it's fun to drive and I think it gets better gas mileage than rated on freeway driving. The styling is the greatest and the power is great. I probably would get better street mileage if I kept my foot out of it, but I love the power response. ;toyota_tacoma
06/18/2008;RANDY;Great truck, good ride, lots of room for 5 people. I have had some problems with engine valve rattle but Toyota says its normal despite any changes in fuel brands and octane levels. Cannot get any help from Toyota on this issue. I suggest getting an extended warranty because the mfg is no help. ;Easy to use controls. lots of storage, I love not having to get the bed sprayed with liner.;toyota_tacoma
05/21/2008;Stephen;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well put together, good gas mileage fun to drive truck. You will not hear a complaint from this owner. I drive typically 160 miles per day and the comfort and reliability are astounding.;The aux. outlet in bed. Lots of storage inside and out. Strong beefy motor. Don't believe the gas ratings, in reality it is a higher mpg.;toyota_tacoma
04/18/2008;mac240;Very nice truck with an excellent ride. This is my third Tacoma and by far the best. I use my truck mainly for personal transportation and I bet I represent a large number of buyers. With that in mind Toyota should make available more creature comforts, i.e., power seats, heated mirrors, a sunroof, auto temp and leather seats. The tire monitor system is useless, it only indicates you have low tire pressure but doesn't tell you which tire. The system GM uses gives you a readout of the tire pressure in each tire, a much more useful system. Even with the short comings I'll buy this truck again. ;Style, power, ride, storage areas.;toyota_tacoma
04/18/2008;Mark;"So, the truck now has 16k miles. Other than the initial axle problem things have been OK. I monitor every tank and the truck was 16 city and 18.5 hwy with canopy until I put new tires on which dropped me 2 mpg (265 70 17) 4wd works flawlessly. The cruise control is still useless-surges gears-and seatbelt and back-up warning quit working. Speaking of tires, despite claims you CAN NOT go wider than 265 without rubbing, even w/ 3"" lift unless you replace the rims and sensors-big $$. Smoking problem has cleared with 3rd synthetic oil change - whew.";"Extremely comfortable, great torque, acceleration and visibility. Great body styling-this is a big ""small"" truck";toyota_tacoma
04/12/2008;SNM;Did an immense amount of research before purchasing. It wasn't even close when all was said and done. If you are looking for a 4 door compact pick up this is your baby. 239 hp in the V6 is more than enough, and avg. 19-20 mpg overall. The interior and ride is superior to competetors. The appearance was aesthetically appealing as well. Toyota has a long history of quality reliability. I previously owned Ford and Nissan pick ups, and the Toyota is my favorite by far. I plan on keeping this one for many years. ;Design, smooth engine, power to mpg ratio. ;toyota_tacoma
03/11/2008;Moved from GM;The truck has done well for me. It has met my expectations to date. The only draw back is the dealer installed cruise control.;Good gas mileage, and a well thought out bed tie down system.;toyota_tacoma
03/07/2008;Tren;Having owned Ford long beds, this truck is far superior in every way except power on hills. I chose the I4 Prerun for value reasons and it's lived up its name. Hauling a motorcycle on a hill with the manual tran at 70 was not a problem nor has getting 22-27 (26-7 if you drive speed limit; my overall avg. is 23.5) on the highway for my daily commute. I've driven 8 hours straight (one stop for gas) and enjoyed comfort comparable to the Accord;toyota_tacoma
01/24/2008;Jamboree;I am in the process of purchasing an 08. I was hit head on at about 50+ mph. and I walked away. The cab was totally intact. I loved my 07 and can't wait to get my 08. Fun to drive and travel in. ;I like the overall look of the truck, the hoodscoop is great!!!;toyota_tacoma
01/20/2008;Dirtydog1776;Purchased this truck to get better mileage than my old 1999 Dodge Dakota. So far gas mileage has been terrible ( I am a careful driver!), the engine is under powered and the rough downshifting on even slight inclines makes the cruise control useless. Ride is spongy, steering is loose, lots of noise from the engine and road.;Appears to be reliable, roomy cab, nice layout, large gas tank.;toyota_tacoma
01/09/2008;Bill;Purchased new 07 Toy to replace a 03 Honda Oddy after much research. Wanted 4 wheel drive. We love driving it when it runs. It has been back to the dealership 4 times and they can't figure out what is wrong. It just will not start. We park it, go to bed and get up in the morning to a truck that won't start. We really like the back country but now we are afraid to go there as we never know whether our toy will run or not. This is our 4th Tacoma, so we thought we were getting quality.;Good to look at, plenty of room, lots of get up and go, when it goes!;toyota_tacoma
12/29/2007;jc01;Everything has been upgraded from what I was used to. Coming from my previous 1999 version of this same truck, the 2007 version is longer, higher, wider, stronger and smarter. I am glad that they have made standard the 4x4 mode being switchable from the dash and also improved rust preventation under the chasis by using thicker steel, other alloys, and rust inhibiting paint. Standard features I would of thought would be extra (bedliner, CD, AC, etc.) There is no comparison out there. Nissan, Ford, Mazda, Dodge, and Chevy can only hope to ever match the quality, dependability, durability, and plain sleek/smart design of the Tacoma. The Toyota Tacoma continues to define the small truck genre.;4drs! Bedliner that is literally a part of the truck, not an after sale afterthought. The adjustible track on the bed to attach bungee cords is really useful. Well designed garage door opener holder. High ground clearance. CD player. Lots of storage space inside and out! Plenty of cup holders.;toyota_tacoma
12/21/2007;PJ;The truck was delivered with everything working correctly and not one mark on the finish. 13,000 miles later everything is still working, no warranty issues to date. The finish does have a few nicks now.;Interior appointments.;toyota_tacoma
12/17/2007;goodhands83;I was looking at the Frontier and the Tacoma. I decided on the Tacoma because of the superior space in the rear seat and Toyota's responsible tradition of workmanship and durability. Not sure if it matters but the battery is huge. I have a double cab short box SR5 Off Road Package and there is plenty of room for adults in the rear seat. As for the problem mentioned by the Editors of this site regarding the low seats, it took my lower back 2 weeks to get used to it but now I love it, all good things take some getting used to. The truck handles great off-road, better than I imagined. This truck is a small tank! It handles curbs at 30-40mph no problem ! oops!;6 disc cd changer, tight suspension, overall spaciousness, comfort, reliability.;toyota_tacoma
12/13/2007;Ut Taco;"This is a perfect truck. After owning two Mazda ""Rangers"" and selling my beloved Jeep Cherokee I vowed to buy a full size truck until I took a spin in the '07 Tacoma. I love this truck. The V6 that gets knocked for being loud is music to my ears. The first 2000 miles on the truck were on a trip to Moab and the truck did not disappoint. It is a joy to drive on and off road. The TRD suspension is more than a cool sticker, it really works. The truck has plenty of room for the wife and two kids. The dealer even installed a 2.5"" lift (sold!). This truck is rugged, solid and fast. 7,500 miles (at least 800 off road) and no problems. Did I say I like my truck?";The whole damn truck! Great motor/powertrain. Off road ability. Good looks. Interior room. ;toyota_tacoma
12/13/2007;AKnight;I absolutely love this truck, although it does lack in some areas for me. Despite having the performance engine and upgrades for a Tacoma, it just doesn't have enough power for me. Also, when I bought my truck the windshield wasn't sealed correctly and it produced very loud whistling at interstate speeds. The local Toyota dealership replaced the entire windshield for free though and now the truck has no problems.;The manual shift 6 speed is very fun to drive with. ;toyota_tacoma
12/11/2007;Raymond8;"My 4-dr, 6 cyl, 5.0 was great until I hit 30K miles. Started having ""slipping"" or transmission problems. Took it in for servicing & got the standard, ""cannot recreate issue."" Also, the Tire Pressure Sensor (TPS) system light comes on for no apparent reason, tire pressure is OK - 3rd time this has happened in 1.5 years. VERY disappointed in Toyota... was hoping to have this truck for 8+ years. Probably going to sell ASAP.";toyota_tacoma;toyota_tacoma
12/04/2007;Bill;This has been an excellent small truck to own. No issues to date. Looks better than most of the new cars in work parking lot.

11/25/2007;Brian;This truck replaced a 1996 Ranger, and the difference between the two was like night and day. Very comfortable, well laid out interior, solid build (rattle free), and great looking - gets lots of admiring stares. I have so far driven this truck about 7800 miles and have no complaints about its ride or reliability. So far, I am getting about 18 mpg city and 22 hwy.;Appearance, sport driver seat, layout of gauges, bed tie downs, storage boxes in beds to hold tie-down straps when not in use, under rear seat cargo boxes.;toyota_tacoma
11/23/2007;Jon;I test drove a previous model year Tacoma and the difference is night and day. I always wanted one and finally broke down after my last vehicle died. The thing that surprised me the most is the outstanding turning radius. I have put about 13k on it since I got it in December last year and have had no issues. All around this is a reliable, comfortable, sleek, and fun drive. Great acceleration. Great handling. Could not be more happy with any other truck. My friends envy me! :);Even though I have a base model with no options on it, it does not bother me, and I am all about options! It has everything you need. Favorite thing about the truck is that it has a lot of room inside. Even sitting in the back is more comfortable than most cars. Feels like a full size vehicle.;toyota_tacoma
11/16/2007;Millsy;This is the first pickup I've owned and I generally have high marks. I imagine it's as capable as any other in its class, and IMO it rides extremely comfortably. One major disappointment is the chintziness inside. My gearshift knob swims in place, while the gearshift itself shimmies endlessly in the front gears (1-3-5). There's also a cheap plastic compartment next to the steering column that doesn't shut properly (and I've never used it). I've also been disappointed by the fuel efficiency. While it reports 23/28, I have yet to get anywhere close to 20 mpg from a tank. From a drive standpoint, the manual 5-speed seems essential for responsive on hills, turns, tough on-ramps, etc.;The access cab is perfectly handy. My 1-year old daughter loves to ride perfectly secure in her car seat on the passenger side. I love the bed cleats (or whatever they're called)- I'm always sliding them around (very easily) to bungy down different stuff I carry around.;toyota_tacoma
11/04/2007;rkrdr2;I love everything about this truck. The v6 is a great engine has plenty of torque,and I am getting 20mpg combined w/ mobil 1 in the crank. The ride is good even w/the TRD sport susp. I think the long W/B helps. I have 9k on it and it has not been back to dealer yet. I get compliments everywhere I go. It is a fun truck to drive.;Engine, 6' bed w/liner, good ride, great looks.;toyota_tacoma
11/02/2007;Rob D;I have been a Nissan guy for over 20 years , I decided to give this little Toyota Taco a try. I must say I am very impressed with the all around quality and I am glad I went with a Toyota. Well built, very tight, smooth on the road, not bad pick up for a 4 cyl. getting good mpg.;Very nice interior design, layout and quality for a vehicle under 20K. I really like everything about the truck. It's perfect for me. ;toyota_tacoma
10/28/2007;SharEd;Makes clunk noise as you pull forward every time (sounds like transmission) and several times we were told that was normal. Now it is being looked at. Brakes squeeled and entire neighborhood laughed at new truck when backing up. Now has squeal in steering when turning either direction and car only has 7200 miles on it. Hate it already. Don't know what will happen next.;Cool red color with black wheel wells;toyota_tacoma
10/16/2007;mark;At 6k the LF wheel bearings, front axle and roter needed to be replaced. (never off-road or accident)Cruise control is useless-jumps gears constantly. Mileage OK at consistant 16.5-18 with a canopy. Blows occasional smoke on startup which got a little better with synthetic oil. Watch for sludge build-up on these motors. Check warranty carefully -Toyota will not look at this problem unless you are losing a quart of oil every 1k miles. Fingers crossed mine is not one of these problems. Thank god I had not installed the lift kit and voided the warranty!;"Comfortable interior, upgraded tow package pulls small motorcycle trailer easially. Good torque and acceleration with V6. 4 door option very roomy for passengers. Good visibility and handeling. Curb appeal. 17"" wheels.";toyota_tacoma

While I loved my full size, I love the improved fuel economy and the great pickup my V6 has. It has all the creature comforts you need and is comfortable. I am 6'4"" and have no problem being comfortable in the front seat, although I wouldnt recommend the jump seats in the rear for any adult over 6'. Could use a little more padding on the seats, but I love the fold flat feature. Makes it easy to load groceries or bulky items. I love the track system in the bed.

09/26/2007;kpri101;I've only had it a few days but after driving a 6 cyl. manual Ford F150 for 4 years this is a godsend. I bought an '07 Tacoma PreRunner with the TRD off road package. It has been an exceptional truck and I've had several of my neighbors/co-workers comment on it. I think I made the right decision. The Indigo-blue looks outstanding.

09/18/2007;Shaggydog1776;Toyota Tacoma offers a reliable vehicle, but option packages were not flexible. Wanted cruise control but that only comes with extended cab. Color and other options very limited. Design is cookie cutter. Lots of extra holes in the dash for accessory switches that will never be used and so on. I4 engine is underpowered making it necessary to manually shift between 3rd gear and drive. Cruise control is useless on roads even with slight inclines. The transmission downshifts constantly with a very jerky motion. Driver and passengers are constantly being thrown back and forth. Even slight side winds whip truck around on highway. Fuel economy not even close to what I thought it would be.;Reliable but plain. Lots of cup holders, jump seats are comfortable even for adults. Seats are comfortable. Build in bed liner.

Driving my '07 is a pleasure. It has a great view of the road, ample power, a smooth-shifting manual 6 speed and ice-cold AC. The seats are comfortable and all of the controls within easy reach.

I'm looking forward to many years of service from this truck!;V6 and 6 speed manual combo, locking rear differential, overall style, fit and finish are first rate. Good storage space in Axcess cab. Great ergonomics!;toyota_tacoma
09/06/2007;Will;After several very positive experiences with Toyota, I came up with a downer. Quite evident, the more Toyota grows, the more it has taken some quality control out of there vehicles. I have 6k miles on mine and have an off and on noise that happens at 75-80 (dealer can't diagnose 'cause they can only drive it up to 70), front dash rattles, passenger door rattles and has had to be towed as it wouldn't start (Thank God I purchased the extended service plan otherwise I would have been really irked paying for towing on a 3 month old truck). I wouldn't mind a littler better mileage but it's not bad. Power is good for a V6 and comfort is good as well. I still like it but wish it were better. ;Power, comfort and on-road handling. ;toyota_tacoma
08/25/2007;m9431;There's a lot to like with the latest Tacoma truck. Nice interior and the V6 is smooth and powerful. Its size is just right. Issues? The auto trans doesn't seem to shift right. Rear springs are weak (I had to replace and I don't haul anything heavy) or put up with it bottoming out. Front end gets out of alignment easily. Does the PreRunner really need to be be so high off the ground? I'd like better MPG, but at least I can get 20 or better.;Nice interior layout. V6 engine pulls and revs well. ;toyota_tacoma
08/22/2007;Todd;This is definitely the best vehichle I have ever owned! I highly recommend this truck to everyone. Easy to drive and fun to get behind the wheel. All systems at the touch of a finger tip. I give My truck 10 stars!!;All within reach!;toyota_tacoma
08/18/2007;Brent;You would be amazed that this vehicle is a truck and not a car, it drives that well. Excellent handling and more than enough power for the road. I haven't owned a Toyota in years but I'm elated to be back. Great design, fabulous handling as well as great fuel mileage make this truck a must have. Don't be misled by believing that a small size truck will give you better fuel mileage and more economy, this Tacoma Pre-Runner will dish out big truck features and save you money at the pump as well!! Remarkable that they can pull it all off with such a nice sized vehicle that doesn't leave you feeling like you stepped out of a shoe box instead of a roomy substantial truck! Fantastic!;Solid styling, feels substantial as well as the ride. I would not change a thing on this vehicle which is very unusual.

My mileage is 18-21 MPG so far. I use my AC quite alot and drive city 60% of the time. Be aware that the brake and gas pedals are very close together in this truck and the steering wheel does not telescope as much as it could. The sound system (basic from factory) is terrible. I would strongly recommend upgrading at the time of sale. ;Versatility of seating. Compass and external temperature reading. Comfort of interior. Good storage in cab. ;toyota_tacoma

Since then I have owned Chevys, Dodges, Internationals, Jeeps and Fords. I have close to a million road miles so I know trucks. This is my first Toyota. I love this truck. I test drove all the others, and I mean all, and this truck is by far the best built, best designed, and best performing. I have 1700 miles on it and for combination driving hwy/city I am getting 24 mpg. Strict hwy driving up 6 & 7% grades from Grand Junction to Denver over the Rocky Mountains and Contenental Divide at 75 mph I got 23.5 mpg. Haven't towed the 4 horse trailer yet, but am sure it will perform.;High gas mileages with plenty of power. I commute 80 miles round trip each day. I live in a high Mt. canyon with a pass of 7000 feet in the middle and 4000 ft elevation on both ends. Spend about 4 hrs city driving for my job so it is a good test for fuel economy.

07/06/2007;jleg;This is my first Toyota and it is quite a change from my Ranger. It is bigger, faster, and gets better gas mileage. The back seat is great for my three kids and the leg room is reasonable for an adult. It could use a bit more brake, maybe rear disks. The paint has a great sheen and very little orange peel compared to other vehicles in its segment. The engine compartment is cavernous and there is actually room to work if you ever need to get to the coil/plugs or the alternator. Not like the shoehorned engine compartments I am used to from past experience. Overall I am very happy with the truck's performance and look. ;Full four doors and a usable back seat for the family is the best part. The fuel economy is 20.3 so far but I am not thru the break in period yet so it should get better. The two tone interior is sharp looking and very well fit. Everything lines up almost perfect. The hood scoop is an eye catcher.;toyota_tacoma
07/02/2007;Neil;I got stuck in a 3 foot puddle - my girlfriend called it more of a lake - at 2000 miles; thank goodness the electronics are mounted high and most have water proof connectors. It dried out well and has given me no problems. I like the truck more now than before I bought it. It still has tuff truck pedigree. It is also one of the quietest trucks I have ever ridden in on the highway. ;toyota_tacoma
06/13/2007;Bill;The acceleration for this 4 cyl auto (SR-5) is very good. I had no trouble, without a heavy load, getting on the highway. The top speed I was able to get it to was 95 mph. I like the overall layout of the vehicle with the small storage area under the rear seats and in the cargo area. The seat and steering adjustments made the vehicle very comfortable to ride in and I had no trouble seeing out the vehicle in all directions. The vehicle's controls are all easy to get to and the radio was simple to operate. ;The four door design is very useful when trying to get behind the front seats. I was unsure about the cargo area with the composite bed. After hauling 500 lbs of rocks in it, I liked it. The rail system is also very useful and I keep my tie downs in the two small storage boxes that are built in.;toyota_tacoma
06/10/2007;satxcubfan;Very tight, well built truck. Extremely comfortable and capable. Runs a lot quieter than my old Ranger. It was like going from a room at Motel 6 to a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. This truck is perfect for me in this configuration and I plan to get many, many miles and years out of it. It's a real head turner on the road, too! I really love it. ;Unique styling, legendary Toyota quality and resale value, (although I won't doing that for a LOOONNNG time).;toyota_tacoma
06/03/2007;Foghorn;"This is my first ""non"" full-sized truck, after 4 Dodges. What I gave up in power and torque, I feel I have made up for in fit and finish. This truck screams quality. It's airtight, the first vehicle I have owned with no rattles or squeaks. The V6 has more than enough get-up-and-go, it handles very well and has a tight turning radius. Brakes are a little spongy but strong. Seats are quite comfortable and supportive. I have not experienced the paint chipping (yet) others have complained about. Too new to gauge mileage. I bought this truck banking on the infamous Toyota quality and longevity and while it's too early to tell, so far I am impressed.";Composite bed, compartments and cupholders, orange dash lights (I thought this would bug me but I like them). Strong fog lights. High quality seat fabric. Overall drivability - it's very comfortable while still maintaining a truck-like ride.;toyota_tacoma
05/30/2007;jaggy9;I looked at many different makes in switching back to a truck from cars and SUVs the past 6 years, and the Tacoma was hands down the best. I was looking for a 4 cyl 4x4 that could handle the everyday drive, some off-roading, and some light hauling. This more than meets my needs, and it's the best looking one out there! The build quality is amazing. It's one of the most solid feeling vehicles I've owned (car or truck). The bigger interior in the last redesign is amazing. I went with the Indigo Ink, SR5 package, and tire upgrade. Love the ground clearance and cannot wait to test this out off-road. MPG have been 21.7 for all city driving. Looking forward to many years of driving my Taco!;Besides the looks I'd have to say interior size and build quality. This truck just feels solid!! For being an access cab, this truck is huge inside. Very nice layout of the dash and controls. I'm very impressed!;toyota_tacoma
05/24/2007;javax;My first truck! I test drove F150 FX4, Nissan Frontier, and Titan but decided to get Toyota Tacoma in the end. I liked the F150 and Titan but I just couldn't buy either one because of gas mileage. The Frontier truck was good also but didn't have many configurations. Tacoma was built like a truck and runs like a truck too. If you want to get a truck that runs like a car, stay away from this one. However, if you are after quality, this one is for you. It lacks (4cyl 4X4) horsepower to accelerate fast on the highway but it handles sharp curves like a car. At high speed around 70 mph, the truck makes quite a bit of engine noise. The exterior is very stylish and interior is well designed.;Good look and functional design. Sits up high, yet very stable on sharp curves.;toyota_tacoma
05/21/2007;ebrown;This is my first Toyota and after having Fords, Chevys and Jeeps. This is the best built vehicle I have owned. It feels like a well built truck. I test drove a Ford Ranger, Nissan Frontier, Chevy Colorado and none feel as tight as the Tacoma.;Storage under the back jump seats. If you forget to turn off the lights they shut off.;toyota_tacoma
05/20/2007;NC Administrator;Great truck, have owned several full size Silverados and am very satisfied with Toyota Tacoma.;Simplicity, reliability, quality.;toyota_tacoma
05/17/2007;G.L. in Indiana;This truck has exceeded my expectations. Excellent power, torque and 4WD function for this size vehicle in standard highway environment hazards ,i.e. snow, ice, rain. I have not been off road with it but it does tow boats effortlessly. Solid, somewhat noisy ride, but delivers the mileage advertised on the sticker which is great .;4.0 V6 VVI motor is a torque machine and a smooth runner. All the motor this truck will ever need and matches gearing perfectly with the locking rear differential and 4WD. ;toyota_tacoma
05/05/2007;Steve;My 4th new Toyota, 2 were 4Runners and a Tundra. This vehicle is the right size and with the double cab and enough bed room for the weekend yard work, kayak, surfboard hauler etc., this truck is perfect. I went with the 4 wheel drive and TRD Sport package w/17' wheels and the ride is great! Everything compared it is hard to beat the quality and interior layout. Try to have everything from the factory re: running boards, roof rack, and not dealer installed if you can help it. I work with BMW and for cars they are 2nd to none, but for my off time this Tacoma is hard too beat!!;TRD Sport Package, roof rack system. The bed compartments,110 volt plug.;toyota_tacoma
05/05/2007;Craig;The 6 speed manual is a poor design, too many gears too close together to be of any use. 6th gear can easily be driven at 50 mph, what happened to an overdrive gear? The cigarette lighter that is disabled with the ignition off is a terrible design. What were they thinking, a cellphone charger will drain a 35lb battery?? Maybe in a few weeks! Why not engineer disabling when the battery gets low? By the way, don't think about charging a cellphone if you are doing stop and go. It really messes up the charging. Gas mileage is about 17 mph for highway driving on the V6. I have not heard of anyone doing better. The 110w outlet is useless, not enough juice to do anything useful. ;Tight turning radius.;toyota_tacoma
05/03/2007;iicei;There is a problem with Toyota paint on these pickups. The water based paint chips very easily. I thought I bought a good dependable truck only to find chipping paint after only 1000 miles of around town driving. I like the truck but the paint problem spoils it for me. Buyer beware. ;Ease of driving.;toyota_tacoma
04/26/2007;bigr;Well it has been one week since I pick up my Toyota Tacoma 4x4 TRD Dbl Cab. I have to admit that I love it. It is well built and very comfortable. Today I towed a trailer with 2 yards of wet topsoil and I almost forgot it was back there. Great power and fuel economy (I hope, I'm still on the first tank of gas). After driving a Chevy S-10 ZR2 for 130,000 miles I was not sure about a Toyota, but it had everything I was looking for, appeared well built and the price compared to equal vehicles was reasonable. It is like driving a car with all the abilities of a truck. Our two Saint Bernards love the back seat and it has enough toys to keep me busy for a while.;The whole truck is nice. Sound system is great, interior comfortable. Quality is evident.;toyota_tacoma
04/19/2007;trmckin;I purchased this vehicle for hauling mountain bikes, light yard work, camping and the occasional light towing job. Thus far, I have not been disappointed. Everything is well laid out and the storage is awesome. Plenty of power to enter Houston freeways with ease or tackle any jeep road. Purchase the sound shield and paint shield. Paint seems a little thin and scratches easily but hey, it's a truck! Highly recommended. Serves my purposes and then some. ;Love the storage bins and the composite bed. Rail system is great with fork bike mount or ski rack. 4WD is idiot proof. 13 cupholders... don't know why but it's good to put water in on those long trips. Stance is agressive and looks great with the black brushguard. Gas mileage good for a truck.;toyota_tacoma
04/12/2007;nick;I have had a large arrray of cars and trucks and this by far beats them all. I do a lot of off road driving and playing around in the mud, and I have yet to be able to get this thing stuck. When I took delivery of this truck I left the lot and headed on a 2000 mi road trip, most comfortable ride and great fuel economy. Does great at highway speeds and around town. I will never get rid of this truck, it will stay in the family for the rest of its life and guess what, it is a Toyota. It's going to be around for a while!;Aggressive styling, quality interior, light weight and great for off roading.;toyota_tacoma
04/05/2007;Lon;Highway rating of 27 MPG is close. I have achieved 26 MPG consistantly on daily commute of 70 mile roundtrip with secondary country roads and some city. Very happy overall.;Pleased generally with all.;toyota_tacoma
04/02/2007;Brian;"Overall great truck. First new truck I have purchased and so far, no major disappointments. Ride gets a little ""squirrely"" when driving on grooved concrete highway, doesn't seem to stay on track. Ride gets bouncy when empty, but not sure what happens when it is loaded. So far, I've only driven it empty. My old truck was a full-size crew cab, and this is a welcome change when buying fuel. So far, getting around 21 mpg, and haven't used cruise control yet. I'm hoping to improve to about 23 mpg. Plenty of power, but I haven't really tested it yet (still in break in). I'm getting used to the shift configuration, and should have it down soon, but it is not what I'm familiar with. ";Smooth shifting 5-speed transmission. Fold-back side mirrors. Sun visors with extensions. ;toyota_tacoma
03/18/2007;iambigdan;I replaced my 12 yr old Toyota pickup with an 07 Tacoma double cab TRD Sport longbed. Nothing wrong with my old truck, just wanted something bigger and with more options/power. Only had it a month but I can tell I will be driving for many years. Decent power, smooth ride. Only problem I had was fitting it in my garage. ;The optional JBL stereo sytem is awesome, especially w/ the steering wheel controls. Movable tie-down cleats have been very useful. The interior trim level is superb.;toyota_tacoma
03/17/2007;GB;I traded my defective Chevrolet Colorado in on a new Tacoma after GM wouldn't stand behind their product. I wish I would have looked at the Tacoma 2 years ago. The interior quality beats Chevy hands down, as does the ride and lack of road noise. There is also no comparison of the stereo system, Toyota beats Chevy without question. The mileage on the 2.7 4 cyl. 4X4 Tacoma has been fantastic. The mileage during the first 3000 miles has been 23 - 24 mpg with about 50% highway driving. I am very happy with my Tacoma.;Interior design and quality, gas mileage.;toyota_tacoma
03/15/2007;Dick Hertz;Picked up my new Tacoma this week and it's quite a truck. Loads of standard equipment. Love the extra doors on the access cab. Terrific factory stereo. Smooooth transmission. Plenty of power for my needs. Sold my old Tacoma SR-5 with 170K trouble free miles to get the new one. It took all of 3 hrs. from the time I placed the ad until the cash was in hand. If this new truck works out as well as the old one, I'll be a happy camper. Don't know why you'd consider any other small truck. ;Stereo, extra doors, extensive standard equipment.;toyota_tacoma
03/12/2007;Troy;I love my new truck, 4dr 4WD 6cyl 5spd Auto, with Off Road Suspension Pkg and Tow Pkg (6500lbs). Ride/suspension is better than anything I would expect from a truck. Very quick when needed and haven't climbed with it yet but plenty of torque @ 266 ft lbs. Quiet smooth ride, great steering/ handling/ shift and great sound system w/upgrd stereo/6cd + subwfr. Plenty of front and back legroom. Quality vs. cost = great value. 18/21 mpg! If you want a compact truck w 4wd, plenty of space, hp, tow capacity, mpg, and quality then Tacoma is best choice for a few 1000 more. ;4wd + 4dr + 6cyl(proven) 236 hp/266 ft/lbs torque + off road + 6500 lbs tow capacity combination with great styling and mpg is the best combination of features I could find. Awesome rear seat/cargo combinations with cool under and behind seat storage compartments.;toyota_tacoma
03/11/2007;swiss123;I moved from a Ford Ranger to a brand new Toyota Tacoma. Much more room and cargo space then the Ranger. Seems to have more acceleration power even with same size engine. Just feels better put together. ;Truck looks like a 4x4 but really isn't. It was nice to not have to spend all that extra money just so it looked cool!;toyota_tacoma
03/10/2007;Matt;Precisely what you should look for in a mid-size. Truck feel but car comfort. Plenty of power for highway acceleration. Gives full-size general duty for V6 gas mileage (20.5 mostly highway driving). Great utility constuction truck!;Composite bed. Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?;toyota_tacoma
03/02/2007;Mike;After having a Chevy S-10 and always wanting a Toyota, I can not be happier. I recently pulled a U-Haul trailer from PA to Florida, it made it seem like I had nothing on the back. My bud, pulled the same with an S-10. I pretty much could have dusted him. He had problems with hills, and I didn't. I also got better gas mileage, which is always a plus. I just like having a truck, even though this is the smaller model, it still rocks, has great power for a little engine. This is my second Toyota, I will never again own anything else. ;I love everything except the fabric on the doors. ;toyota_tacoma
02/27/2007;LtH;I'm very satisfied with the Taco, lives up to the reviews, and would buy it all over again. The visibility is great, and 5 adults fit comfortably. It feels solid, and handles well both on streets & freeways. My goals were to get a vehicle with better than average reliability that rode a little higher off the ground and the Taco fit the bill as a great investment. I'm a happy first time Toyota owner & first time truck owner. ;The powerful engine and responsive acceleration & brakes. No-nonsense controls for AC and radio. Practicality of being able to move my own stuff for a change. ;toyota_tacoma
02/27/2007;DS07Taco;Drives quiet and smooth, brakes seem a little soft;" occasional ""surge"" at stop with foot on brake pedal, but nothing major. Great ergonomics and functionality in interior";toyota_tacoma
02/24/2007;MGisi;Nice vehicle, engine is a bit noisy. Toyota needs to improve their quality control process. I had to take my new truck back the first week to have a defective tire and defective brake drums replaced.;Interior roominess.;toyota_tacoma
02/20/2007;Jon;Great truck, poor exterior design with paint chipping problems. My truck has 1500 miles on it and the rear fender flares have no paint left on them. Toyota is repainting it, but who wants a brand new truck repainted already. ;Great truck except the paint.;toyota_tacoma
02/16/2007;SC;After driving all the midsize trucks, Toyota was my pick. I would do it again even though there a few complaints, the primary one being that it has 3 or 4 impossible to find intermittant rattles, each being heard only when hitting its own unique road bump. Perhaps the firm riding Off Road package causes some of the problem. Also, a small nitpick: what's with the cloth arm rest on the door that will look soiled within a year? This is a truck, not an Avalon! Additionally, the engine fan causes excessive noise, even during fast idle warmup. Finally, there is no tailgate lock. After 3500 miles there has not been any warranty work required.;Quiet ride. Great looking interior. Ther sport seats are perfect. Powerful, smooth and economical engine that gets 20 mpg in urban/surburban driving. Exceptionally smooth auto transmission that is into high gear by 35 mph, helping maximize city mpg. Lots of storage space under and behind rear seats.;toyota_tacoma
02/15/2007;Marty;After a month of thorough research I narrowed it down to the Frontier and Tacoma. The Tacoma was roomier. It does have some spongy brakes that need to get used to (TRD 4x4). Interior is an A+! Good power and ride. Very comfortable seating. I have owned Chevys all my life. This is the first Toyota that I have purchased. Sold my 04 Colorado Z71 crew cab. This blows it away hands down. Even though I bought the fully loaded Colorado, it just feels cheap to drive when compared to the Tacoma. Great job Toyota! Some additional lighting for the 4x4 and various other switches would help. Also, I had to order a cabin filter. Toyota makes the slot for one but does not place one in there? C'mon. ;Interior (high class), power, comfort.;toyota_tacoma
06/27/2009;Owly52;I just had a BMW x5 and I just hated not having a third row seat and had 3 kids and had a lot of play dates! When my lease was up I could not wait to get a new car. I was looking at the Highlander and didn't like it as much as the Sequoia. I got just a couple of weeks ago and now I love to get out of the house! I love the second row captain chairs and removable center console. I think I should never get a new car again because I bought mine! ;Third row window comes down, bucket seats in second row, nav. system, heated front seats, I got to admit everything about the Sequoia I like!!;toyota_sequoia
06/20/2009;K Brown;The Sequoia is an excellent SUV. Reliability has been great. At 25,000 miles repair of the tension control for the fan belt was required, up to 38,500 now and no other repairs. Like the looks of the 2007 better than the new style. Would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV that is big and holds a lot of stuff. Even got a full/queen size headboard in the back. ;DVD system with headphones. ;toyota_sequoia
05/15/2009;Dave;I've had my Sequoia for a little over two years now and though I love driving the vehicle and it works well for my family of five, I am 15,000 miles past my manufacturer's warranty and already have over $2,000.00 in repairs. I was lucky enough to have purchased the extended warranty so I haven't had to pay for these repairs out of pocket but I am very worried about what this vehicle is going to cost me in the long run. I am pretty sure I will dump it when it is paid for. This is a shame because I really like the vehicle from a users point of view. My last issue was with the fuel pump at 45,000 miles. The part alone is over $600.00 from the dealership. That excludes labor. ;Plenty of room. Interior works well for my family. Comfortable to drive.;toyota_sequoia
04/25/2009;Timothy;This is the most practical and stylish vehicle I have owned. I refuse to drive a mini van;DVD, leather & heated seats.;toyota_sequoia
01/07/2009;Grouse;I've only had this vehicle for 2000 miles but so far I am pleased. It rides a little tougher than I'd hoped (on a smooth road it's great but where are those) but it doesn't jar your teeth loose and it's taut and quiet. The 08 fixed all my gripes about this model except the price, I couldn't justify another 25K for fold down seats and that wonderful 5.7L in the 08. Drive 65 for 500 mi, you'll be surprised (pleasantly). Having a trained ear, the JBL is simply not worth the money to me, but for R&R I'm sure it's just fine.;I like looking at it and the drivers seat is very comfortable. Utilitarian wise it suits my needs.;toyota_sequoia
09/22/2008;dwmclean;I am very disappointed in the engineering / design ergometrics of my 2007 Sequoia Limited. The console controls are not lighted (side mirrors, seat heater) and in a poor location because the seat heaters can be turned on by laying an item across the console. No dash indicator light for fog lights. The gas mileage is poor (16 mpg highway and 14 around town). Rear storage compartment won't stay latched. Second seats will stay folded up (must restrain with a tether). I have factory nav system and satellite radio not available. Limited slip differential doesn't lock (engaging TRAC OFF seems to help but that doesn't make sense). I wish I had my Chevy Tahoe back!! ;None ;toyota_sequoia
09/04/2008;Ted;I bought a Toyota for their supposed great customer satisfaction and reliability. I must say that this not what I have experienced. The car does start and run just fine. The problem lies in all the little things going wrong and the number of times that dealer visits are required. So far both mirrors have gone loose. The clock has failed, the rear hatch won't stay open, the power outlets have failed ... the list goes on. On top of that, the dealer and Toyota Corporate are great at stating that not all problems can be fixed under warranty even though the warranty has not expired. I still have 18 months left on the warranty and 10k miles to go. ;Smooth ride, always runs;toyota_sequoia
06/28/2008;Big Daddy;The 2007 Sequoia is a great vehicle for a family with too much stuff. Ample storage room, comfortable seats. No issues over the first 10K miles. Great build quality, fairly quiet interior. Tires seem to wear well. Have avgd around 20 miles/gallon on hwy. Around 15 city. Overall great looks, fun to drive. Much better value compared to the 2008s. Would buy again.;toyota_sequoia;toyota_sequoia
01/16/2008;OOwl;"After owning a 4Runner for the past 6 years, we needed a bit more room (we travel with show dogs to dog shows and needed the space for crates), we upgraded to the Sequoia. I wanted the '07 version since I like the body style better than the '08s. I love the vehicle but it does ride louder and a bit ""rougher"" than my '07 4Runner. This vehicle is WAY too big not to have a backup camera, so we are having that added immediately. I also like the a/c and heater controls more than in my 4Runner. LOVE the universal remote to open my garage and don't know how I ever lived without the heated seats! I really overall love this car and expect to still be driving it in 10 years!";Arctic Frost Pearl paint (BEAUTIFUL and unique color), NAV system (which I think works fine despite the other reivews here to the contrary), heated seats, rear DVD, moonroof (however, 4Runner adjusted to avoid windthrob and Seq one does not), universal remote garage door opener, remote ignition.;toyota_sequoia
12/10/2007;gagrice;As a confirmed Toyota hater, I was surprised at how much I liked this vehicle. Not sure how long I will keep it. I wanted a diesel Mercedes. I did not like the MB 7 speed transmission. This is MUCH smoother and less intrusive. ;Performance, ride and comfort. It is so much smoother riding than my 05 GMC on our crappy freeways. ;toyota_sequoia
12/06/2007;abbylou;I have had this vehicle for 6 mos now and just love it! Comfortable and great tow vehicle for our midsize boat. Better gas mileage than most other large SUVs. Engine is both smooth and full of torque. I have the pkg that has the rear captain chairs and would recommend this seating unless you have 5 kids.;Stereo is good as it is a JBL. Transmission shifts smoothly and exterior design is appealing.;toyota_sequoia
11/30/2007;gagrice;I had my mind set on the new GL320 CDI Mercedes. I test drove it and did not like the 7 speed transmission. On a fluke I drove the Sequoia. I really do not like Toyota. I do like this SUV. It is not a diesel that I wanted but it is a very nice ride. On a trip to AZ I was not at all tired after 5 straight hours behind the wheel. I would recommend it.;Ride, comfort, smooth engine and transmission response. Good seats compared to many new luxury SUVs. ;toyota_sequoia
10/29/2007;Love it!;Love this car! What a great car for our long road trips and also all the in town day to day driving too. Nav and the DVD are great and a must have. The third seat comes in handy for extra family in town and can fold up or be taken out easily. The 2nd row bucket seats that recline with very large console is very nice and our teenager loves it. We will have this car for many years to come. We get 14.3 mpg in town.;Navigation!! 3rd seat when needed, radio controls on steering wheel, DVD that we can connect game systems to for long trips, outlets in car just like home for anything.;toyota_sequoia
09/15/2007;Former Acura MDX Own;This vehicle is really fabulous. I have been a life long owner of Acura/Honda vehicles and now am extremely happy with my new purchase of a 2007 Toyota Sequoia Ltd. in June 2007. I've had many knee operations and this vehicle provides me with ample leg room while all of my previous vehicles did not. Everything about this Sequoia is really perfect. And regarding the fuel mileage, I average 15.4 miles per gallon and that is almost as good as I was getting with the Acura MDX. If you are in need of a safe, heavy, roomy, and reliable SUV this is your one! My daughter convinced me to buy the Sequoia and it was a great move. ;Really everything!;toyota_sequoia
08/20/2007;hihiheidi;We purchased this SUV after owning a Durango for 8 years and what a difference! Smooth ride, lots of room, especially with two kids. We bought the luxury package and love the second row captains chairs and the center console. The kids can keep all of their things (videos, head phones, games, etc.) all in one place. I splurged and got a wood-wrapped steering wheel, which makes the car feel like a luxury vehicle. And I second the vote on Artic Frost Pearl, best color ever! It is very pretty!;Navigation system, entertainment system, airbags.;toyota_sequoia
08/07/2007;Noleterp01;We were in the market this year for a larger SUV expecting our second child, and looked at everything on the market to be fair. It came down to the Expedition and the Sequoia. The Sequoia is by far the best full size SUV you can get for the money. We were also able to get ours at an exceptional value, considering Toyota is cleaning the lots this time of year. Perfect for a two baby/child family. Decent on gas, and the ride is as smooth as most cars. We couldn't be happier and are officially a Toyota family. We bought a black SR5 with appearance package, tan interior, sunroof, towing package. It is a sharp SUV and we are looking forward to taking it on our first road trip soon.;Powerful and smooth engine. Child latch in the third row. Huge sunroof. Front and back A/C. Loads of room inside. General looks of the vehicle. Toyota reliability and fit and finish.;toyota_sequoia
08/03/2007;Jenny;I've always been a skeptic about the performance of our Toyota Sequoia, but after a recent car accident I can't imagine a safer car. My sister recently endured a traumatic car crash with our Sequoia flying 10 feet in the air and flipping three times and she came out shaken but nearly unscathed. The Toyota Sequoia is built like a tank and guarantees both the satisfaction of a SUV and a safe vehicle. It's quite literally a life saver.;Our sound system and navigational system was absolutely amazing!;toyota_sequoia
05/13/2007;big fan;The Sequoia is one of the best SUVs we have owned or test driven. It's a great vehicle and one of the smoothest rides. It's also a great looking car. The color of our Sequoia is Arctic Frost and it is one of the most beautiful colors ever. It's a creamy white with an irridescent pearl flakes in it. We had the headrest DVDs put in for our boys and they can both either watch the same or different movie or connect their gamecube. It's great for long trips. I will definitely keep the Sequoia in our family. We have gone from being Ford drivers to Toyota. Our next Toyota will be a Tundra for my husband.;I love the color of our car... Arctic Frost!;toyota_sequoia
04/10/2007;mrsanky;This car has everything, a little rough on off road, but would not change a thing.;Center row captain chairs.;toyota_sequoia
03/05/2007;stuka;Have had this SUV since 2001 when they first came out. Have 116,000 miles on her. Hope for another 116,000. Great styling. Now I see so many of them on the road. Can't wait to see the new styling. ;Easy to park. Turns very well. Even with all those miles I know it won't break down.;toyota_sequoia
11/21/2006;GP;I decided to test drive a Sequoia... I took it home an hour later. This is an extremely quiet and smooth ride. Solid workmanship makes this the ultimate in style, comfort and an all around SUV that remains timeless. Well done Toyota, I'll be back for another one if this ever goes out. I currently have 93k on it, runs like a brand new Sequoia.;Quiet ride, VSC/TRAC, smooth shifting, rear window rolls down, great stock stereo system, ergonomic cluster layout.;toyota_sequoia
10/20/2009;VPA;The 2007 GTI is a very well made car, the only significant repair after 90K miles was rear wheel bearings. There was also a problem with the PCV valve which was fixed under a service bulletin. The car also loses or burns some oil - not unexpected for a turbo, I guess, but you must check the oil regularly. Numerous interior squeaks and rattles were corrected after I replaced the horrid stock Continental tires with BFG SuperSport A/S and then Goodyear Eagle GT A/S. Ride and handling are great, the stability control is excellent. No steering feel due to the electric steering, but you learn to live without it. An almost perfect, practical sporty 4- dr hatch at a reasonable price.;Great torque and tall gearing make it a joy to shift through the gears with both power and reasonable fuel economy. Perfect for point-and-squirt moves through traffic. The dual-zone climate control (not offered in other years) is great - not expected in this price range. Always solid and stable.;volkswagen_gti
08/08/2009;Chris C;Its just a fine piece of engineering. This car feels absolutely solid and locked on to the road. Driving becomes more intuitive when the car goes exactly where you point it, when you point it. Anyone who has ever driven an American car should be familiar with the amount of sag or 'play' between the actual motion of the steering wheel and whats transmitted to the wheels. That's what makes German cars so awesome - wheels turn with the drivers hands. The DSG is just about the most underrated technological innovation ever. This trans is a blast, blowing through gears at speeds previously unimaginable for any gearbox. Learn about how the dual clutch works -- its worth the education.;DSG Gearbox Launch Control ESP Optional Paint (Fahrenheit :) Steering Wheel Seats Moon Roof;volkswagen_gti
06/30/2009;Smyrnios;"My GTI has been with me for two years and 17K miles, and the experience has been positive. This is the original ""hot hatch"", the benchmark for this class. If you're looking for outright performance, go for a Mazdaspeed 3. But if you're seeking European character and sophistication, the choice is clear. The GTI goes about its business in a most German way. Feels solid as a bank vault when you get in and shut the door. On the interstate, it's unflappable and deceptively fast, so invest in a good radar detector. This model has ceased production, as the sixth-generation is already out and headed to the US in the fall of 2010. There should be many pre-owned examples to choose from."; Engine sounds great under full throttle. GTI built in Germany, not Mexico as previous model. Xenon headlamps standard. High quality exterior paint finish. Beefy steering wheel you want to caress. Full-size spare tire. Elegant enough for the country club valet, if the occasion were to arise.;volkswagen_gti
06/10/2009;Stuart N;My '07 GTI is the most enjoyable new car I have ever owned. It's the perfect size and I've got plenty of space for people and cargo, too. VW styling never gets old and the retro interior is cool, comfortable and durable. The DSG is best auto-manual transmission ever made. It makes the car feel sporty without making me feel tired. It's a sports car that doesn't beat you up. But stick to the base car and skip the leather package. Otherwise you have a $30K GTI.;DSG, retro seats, xenon lights, handling and steering, radio. ;volkswagen_gti
06/06/2009;Uthor;I bought the GTI to have a fun car to drive while still being able to live with it day by day. It has more than enough power for the street. Quick steering and an easy to use 6-speed gear box, but the clutch travel is long. There is a huge aftermarket to tweak the car to exactly how you want it. Fits four people with ease. The hatch is a bit small compared to my last car's trunk, but cavernous once the rear seats fold down. Adequate 6-disc CD stereo for a non-audiophile. I've had no mechanical problems. The biggest problem with owning the car is how expensive maintenance can be, especially if down at the dealer, but the recommended 10,000 miles between oil changes helps with that.;Powertrain. Interior accent lights at night. 30+ mpg easily achieved if driven with care. Much fun if driven without care. Big aftermarket. Multi-Function Display in dash for car info (mpg, etc), radio control, and car options.;volkswagen_gti
03/25/2009;Nick S.;I've had my GTI for almost two years now, and it's easily the finest car I've ever driven. There were so many duds that followed the 1983 original, but Volkswagen finally got serious again about this iconic model. The engine is the star here, propelling what's not a light vehicle with gusto. It pulls from below 2000 rpm, which means there's virtually no turbo lag. Great car for darting around Manhattan traffic, but the open road is where it shines. Buckets of torque make passing a breeze, and the VW is unflappable at high speed. Overall reliability has been surprisingly solid. Fuel economy has been atrocious.;"2.0L turbo engine sourced from Audi, xenon headlamps, quality interior materials, induction ""tube"" that pipes in engine/exhaust sounds into cabin.";volkswagen_gti
02/25/2009;sunsetswan;"I have owned this car for 2 years now. This has been, overall, the best car I have ever owned, and I have owned a lot of vehicles over the last 40 yrs of driving. The quality is exceptional and the driving puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. The fun factor and mileage make it a ""10"". ";"The DSG transmission is wonderful. 18"" Hefs our great. Gas mileage is good. Fun to drive factor. ";volkswagen_gti
01/16/2009;Dad&#039;s Taxi;The GTI is amazing. gets better with age. Perfect for urban areas-- park it anywhere. Equally at home ripping down curvy country roads in the mountains or cruising on the highway. Equipped with winter wheels/tires/roof box it easily can take four skiing or riding. Cruising range over 400 miles-fill ups are infrequent. VW put the money where it counts in this new gti. The handling is crisp and predictable. Squirt through some traffic and take the exit a little faster or go for a Sunday drive and enjoy motoring with the windows down and sunroof open. Sound and options could be better. If you can only own one car this is it. buy it used and save some $. Fun and reliable. kids luv it. ;volkswagen_gti
01/06/2009;FirstVW;This car is fun in every way and has all the little features that make it feel more expensive than it is. The engine is so torquey, I never wanna drive a VTEC again. Perfect gear ratios in the 6 speed. Makes my 20 mile daily commute fun. Your car should be fun.;Everything;volkswagen_gti
12/30/2008;ksmith;This car is outstanding! I have a loaded 2 door model and have had it for 2 years. It's the best car I've ever had. People constantly stop me to ask me about it.

A lot of attention is paid in the finish details like a luxury car. In my shopping stage, it took me awhile to get over the stigma of the VW reliability that I heard from EVERYONE, but after doing a lot of research, the GTI is probably the BEST BET in the VW market. I got the candy white 4 door, and it's a beauty! The DSG transmission makes driving an auto more fun than it should be, however it takes time to get use to it, but it's a whole new experience. For city livin' and city drivin', this is the best practical and FUN car for my needs!";The DSG transmission and performance, steering wheel, plaid cloth (I like it), plenty of space for a compact car, 4-doors are a must for me, red calipers, and good gas mileage, telescopic steering wheel. This car is a great mix of speed and practicality.;volkswagen_gti

11/08/2006;mvaillan;There is an unbelievable difference between the 1.8L turbo (170hp) in my Passat and the 2.0L Turbo (200hp) in this GTI. It also feels a lot stronger than the 2.0L Turbo (210hp) that I had in my 2002 WRX, and overall is a much nicer car than the WRX, quicker off the line, better quality materials throughout, and you always feel in complete control of the GTI. This GTI wants to move out fast whether you have the DSG Auto transmission in normal drive mode, sport mode or manual shift mode. It shifts silky smooth in all three modes. The paddle shifters on the steering wheel are more toys than anything else, but really fun ones!;I love the 2.0L turbo engine and the DSG auto transmission that combine to make this one fast Rabbit. Also, like the four doors, which makes the back seat very accessible and usable.;volkswagen_gti
10/31/2006;jman;This car is fun to drive. It's quick and nimble, and goes fast in a hurry. The seats are great. If you drive in the city, the automatic is perfect. They finally made a GTI like it's supposed to drive. Get it with four doors, drop the kids off at school and spend the day zipping around town. It's also under the radar screen, people look but don't oogle. It's really a prefect car. Let's see how it does on the long term. The people at VW still need to work on service.;The fun factor!;volkswagen_gti
10/24/2006;Rich;"I researched this car for months and looked at many different competitors, all of which averaged twice the price. After researching every scrap of opinion available, I came to want this car. My research somewhat prepared me for it, but the first drive took me out of this world. The performance to price ratio in this car makes it a lion, and the pure enjoyment of feeling the 200hp acceleration, really puts it in a class far above the price point. If you have ""low ego emissions"" and want something REALLY fun to drive, go GTI. You can't go wrong with this car. It's simply amazing, and the voluminous articles out there in the rags have NOT steered me wrong. I love this car!";200hp, 6-speed manual transmission, and unbelievable shifting experience.;volkswagen_gti
10/23/2006;gwolson;What a blast! No one beats me at the lights. This car is always tempts me to drive fast. This is my first automatic transmission in decades, the DSG with paddle shifters is the most fun. While the other guy is shifting your done and can see his frustrations in the rear view. There is nothing to not like about this car. I am sure that the poor gas mileage is my fault.;Mow fast it is.;volkswagen_gti
10/19/2006;yuray;The DSG transmission is awesome. Somehow (maybe double clutch) it smooths out driving at low speeds while retaining the juice. It feels taut inside (apparently it is assembled in Germany in contrast to almost all other VW models). Unfortunately, the stereo display is third world and the Sirius trial is worthless because you only have a sample of channels. The sunroof could be bigger. The interior trim is spare, bordering on cheap. I see part of the reason why the A3 goes for more. I have the cloth, which is alright, but the seats don't feel like they'd treat me well on a long drive. I am glad that I chose the 4-door. It is not bigger than the 2-door, but seems to get more out of the rear row while maintaining near identical trunk space.;The exterior styling;volkswagen_gti
10/18/2006;dgb;The VW GTI is more fun to drive than the BMW 325i and it holds four comfortably with room for the dog in the hatch. It even costs about $15,000 less than a similarly-equipped BMW. It is larger and cheaper than the Audi A3. It is almost as much fun to drive as the Mini Cooper S, but sized for non-hobbits. It has the best transmission available - period. I have had it for only one month and 800 miles, but it has no rattles, squeaks, or problems of any kind. Its gas mileage has been 27 mpg combined using manual shift/sport mode and a heavy foot. It gets 30+ on the highway.;The DSG transmission, leather sport seats, iPod port in the glovebox, and how GTI sightings in New England are rare (no AWD? Who cares?).;volkswagen_gti
10/15/2006;Sasha;"This is the best GTI ever. It is so much fun to drive. It has amazing handling. If you are over 40 years old - stay away from 18"" tires - they make the ride too rough. If you don't want to spend on winter tires and change them before every winter - stay away from 18"" tires. Other than that, this is probably the most bang for your buck in a long time.";The pickup, speed, hadling, and cornering - it just hugs the road.;volkswagen_gti
09/26/2006;SpitfireCole;After trading in a 350Z with reliability problems, I wanted something practical that would still be fun to drive. With the GTI, I do not feel like I made much of a sacrifice. This car is a blast to drive. It is quick and nimble. I'm not sure that I'm a joiner type, so the VW community still scares me a little..but I love the car.;This car is an absolute pleasure to drive. It has responsive steering and acceleration. Plus it gets decent gas mileage: 24/31 mpg.;volkswagen_gti
09/25/2006;nostatic;"I've never owned an ""auto"" tranny car until my DSG-equipped GTI. I was injured and couldn't work a clutch for a couple months. But I also club race and like control and performance. I also need to haul music gear and my 10 year old son to the beach, etc. This car does all of it and then some. It offers great luxury with the leather, heated seats, and climate control. The 2.0T engine has plenty of punch and the DSG transmission is a chameleon: drive it easy in D, harder in S, or full in manual mode with the paddle shifters. I drove an A3 also (same platform) but the GTI was more fun to drive *and* has more headroom, shoulder room, and more room in the back. I highly recommended this car. My other car is a '79 Porsche 911 that I'll never sell.";The DSG transmission, not much turbo lag, tons of room, nice appointments, and how it is so fun to drive.;volkswagen_gti
09/25/2006;Joe;This car is awesome. It has 200 hp and 207 lb. feet of torque! It gets up and goes. For those of you who are worried about reliability consider this: previous models where built in Mexico, this GTI is built in Wolfsburg, Germany. Its handling is top notch for a car that weighs 3,000 lbs. It is faster than its main competitor, the Honda Civic Si.;The luxury interior, satellite radio through the head unit, controls on the steering wheel, and the engine sounds and performs great! I love this car's back seat room, 6 disc in dash CD and MP3 player. The iPod link that charges instead of having to used the cig lighter outlet is neat. The metalic paint job is top notch.;volkswagen_gti
09/18/2006;SarahB37;After test driving several cars (Mazda3, MINI, Subaru WRX, Rabbit etc) I decided to purchase the GTI. I knew right away that it was the car I wanted. It is so much fun to drive. It is very powerful, handles corners great, the interior is very comfortable, it has a quiet ride, gets good gas mileage, is safe, etc. It comes with built in Sirius Satellite radio. I was concerned about the electrical issues VWs are known for when researching cars, but was reassured by the fact that the GTI is made only in Germany and that the electrical issues have been addressed.;The interior, the quiet ride, satellite radio, the exterior (I've had many compliments), the pep, and the safety features.;volkswagen_gti
09/17/2006;Jon from Tampa;"From the moment I test drove one of these I had to have one. I drove a 2003 A4 before this and this car blows my Audi away! This car is near perfect from the factory, however, if I could recommend two things to current owners to make it PERFECT: Eibach Pro-kit springs and APR Stage I chip. Period. The springs lower the car about 1"" and the chip adds about 45 HP and roughly 80-90 ft lbs. of torque (as if it doesn't have enough already:) which is just enough to bring the performance up to a level that allows this car to compete with 350Z's, G35's, Boxsters, 330Cis, and even IS300's. ";The smooth turbo and power delivery are unmatched in the industry, The handling / cornering (the Eibach springs help a lot with body roll) and the aggressive stance that it has are great. I get more looks with this car than my in my Audi.;volkswagen_gti
09/16/2006;Matt the VW Lova;The new GTI comes now in a four door model. The 2006 and 2007 modles have the new 2.0L turbocharged engine with 200 HP insted of the old 2006-2002 modles which had the 1.8L turbocharged engines with about 170HP. The turbocharger adds a lot of gas milage and gives it a lot of all around power. The exterior looks awesome, it looks very fast, don't you think, even the new 4 door version. The new Honda Civic Si is cool, but it does not have the turbocharger and the GTI gives you a lot more space for luggage. The rims avalible on the GTI are also way better than the Honda. That's what I think anyhow. I am not saying that the Honda is a is bad or anything, in fact Hondas are great cars but the Volkswagen GTI is the way to go.;I love that it has an input so you can plug in your iPod. The paddles are also very cool, most cars don't have that where you can shift gears without taking your hand off the wheel. The plaid seat are in style and are very comfortable. The grill is also really cool with the red pin-stripe.;volkswagen_gti
09/10/2006;Steve;The combination of the versatility of the DSG transmission (spring for the extra grand) with an amazingly torquey engine, makes this one special car for the price. The four door version, in my opinion, improves its profile over the two door model, not to mention it adds utility. The GTI's fit and finish are of the highest quality. It's a better looking than the Audi A3 for about eight grand less. The only downside so far is that collision insurance (as with most VW's) costs quite a bit more than average.;"The DSG transmission and engine (power from down low), standard xenon lights, standard ""cloth"" seats, foward visibility (almost no hood visible), and safety features - airbags galore.";volkswagen_gti
09/06/2006;jimbo;The handling is better than ever. The performance is everything you read. The rear seat is roomier than my wife's mini-SUV (really!). And the computer says the engine has averaged 32.0 mpg in 7500 miles of mixed but usually gentle (ok... not quite always gentle) driving.;The handling, engine, interior layout, rear seat comfort and roominess, headlights, fuel economy, and fun. This is perhaps my favorite car ever.;volkswagen_gti
09/02/2006;Mil-town native;I just got it and am loving it. I broke the 600 mile mark (safety purposes) and starting to break it in. She wants to go, that's all there is to it. I thought about getting the automatic, but missed the clutch and it's cheaper (1,075). It holds corners well, I would just like a little more response through the steering wheel. It has amazing leg room in the back. The shoulder room does not accommodate three sets of broad shoulders (being an ex-swimmer, it's hard to find that in a small car). With the seats down you have more room than you expect. I almost bought Mazda3. The GTI is a little more money but makes up for it in style and power.;I love the seat style and bucket design, body style, the rims (standard spoke, not the giant circle pattern), rear hatch release, driver display and gauge cluster...list goes on...;volkswagen_gti
08/31/2006;neu2dubz;This car ROCKS! This is my all time favorite car. I have owned roughly two dozen cars in the past 17 years and this by far beats them all.

Not only did I end up with the best car I have ended up with a new family also and i love it!;The performance.;volkswagen_gti
08/22/2006;MaD HuNGaRIaN;This is simply the best car I have ever owned. The DSG transmission is awesome.

I'm getting nowhere with the dealership. If it wasn't for this problem, I love the car.;Love everything!;volkswagen_gti
10/05/2008;Mike;I bought this car with 19,000 miles, trading in a BMWX3. If you drive it conservatively, it's comfortable, economical, the hatch makes it versatile and it provides a lot of amenities that you get with more expensive cars. When you want it, the power and handling are terrific. The ride is a bit rough on rough roads but that was expected with low profile tires. I have had owned several sports sedans but always thought the power came at the expense of handling. This car makes a lot of sense and I could not be happier. Finally, one unexpected benefit is the cloth seats which are cooler than leather in the summer sun. The car cools quickly after a stint in a parking lot. ;Overall versatility with superior driving performance;volkswagen_gti
08/19/2008;MH;I am 6'5 and this car proved itself to be great, roomy, sporty, economical and attractive. I traded my VW Gti 337 Ed, due to thinking that it will break down as soon as I run out of warranty. Unfortunately I should have kept it. After 7 months of ownership the '07 GTi came across an issue, a clunking noise in the front of the suspension. I went to research this on a vw forum and it turns out plenty of people have this problem. I attempted to fix this under warranty & even dealt with VWOA and no fix has been found, better yet it couldn't been replicated despite the fact that I had proof on video of many random recurrence and having a service manager replicated it to the quality rep from vw.;The exterior, interior, performance & economical (330 miles to a full tank).

08/07/2008;dave;After 22 months of ownership, this car beats all others that I have owned. NO trips to the dealer for anything but scheduled service, great performance and comfort, pretty good fuel economy (29 average city/hwy, goes down to 27 when driving 80+ on highway)--and it cost $26,000.

06/09/2008;Tony Scavo;Always wanted a GTI since the MK1 in 1983, finally got one almost 25 years later and I got the special edition. Wahooo, power/Torque is incredible for a 4 cyl turbo hatchback, reliability is perfect (currently have 27,000 miles on it after 10 months of ownership and the only issue i have had is figuring out where I'm going to drive next - best car i have ever owned, dead serious. I have driven it through death valley and into the yosemite valley, from Vegas to Denver and even up a dirt mountain driveway ( with snow chains ) and it has never failed me. The exhaust note is great and I added a K&N Intake which makes it sound even better.

05/30/2008;GTI Fanboy;After testing many cars (Fit, Mazda 3, Accord, Passat, Legacy, A3) I decided to go with the GTI 4-door. I don't regret my purchase in the least. The car is a lot of fun to drive and the seating position is great. The powertrain is fantastic, with torque available everywhere, and the DSG is flawless. The car has a nice compromise of ride quality and handling. The interior is ergonomically perfect except for cruise control, and is made out of high quality materials (and the plaid seats are a plus). The hatchback design is very versatile and manages to hold items that would just not fit in a sedan. Fuel economy is better than the 2007 EPA rating. 14K mi trouble free and only 1 minor rattle!;"Perfect engine, DSG, form fitting seats, 17"" Denver alloy wheels (mini Huf's), I love the minutely adjustable knob for seatback angle, Climatic holds 72 degrees very well, longer Euro svc. intervals, steering wheel and its controls, ambient lighting, trip computer, ESP, lots of airbags, safe.";volkswagen_gti

02/21/2008;BMani;I traded in my Land Rover for this car and I haven't missed the rover one bit! The interior is set up wonderfully. I did not care for the looks of this car, but once I drove it I fell in love. The GTI has plenty of room and the addition of two doors helps as well. I LOVE THIS CAR!;The DSG transmission, and interior setup. The red illumination lights that light up the console at night are very neat. ;volkswagen_gti

Dealer had to replace the harness.For a new car with 3500 mile I'm not impressed. Have always owned Hondas or Subaru and the Germans have got a bit of catching up to do. Oil filter is in an inconvenient place. You need to remove the shield on the bottom of the engine for access and it cost $12. Car lacks top end. Handles nice but awd would be a plus. Nice styling, comfortable seats, convenience of hatchback, My first and probably last VW;Seats and stereo. Nice subwoofer.;volkswagen_gti
12/18/2007;microbreak;Love the car. Would definitely purchase again. The only complaint stems from a glitch in the nav-equipped stereo. The Sirius unit sometimes forgets its presets.

The steering wheel feels just right, the seats are supportive, the a/c controls are intuitive, and the seat heaters are GREAT. ;volkswagen_gti
11/03/2007;fh;I've had this car for one year. Fun car to drive, and its utility has been important to me. The gas mileage is reasonable for the engine performance as well. Excellent fit and finish, and only one questionable item in terms of any defect, which has not been a problem. I wanted a car with a sunroof, still having reasonable headroom. That put the Hondas (Civic and Accord coupes) out of contention, by comparison.;The engine's torque and flexibility are outstanding. The shifter is smooth, not as short throw as perhaps a few other manual transmissions, but not bad. Good room in the useful back seats, which split-fold. Interior materials are first-rate in this price range. Plenty of headroom for tall folks.;volkswagen_gti
10/10/2007;falconeight;I really wanted a Mini, but thought that I would check out the GTI first just to be sure, and I never made it to the mini dealer. This is by far a great hatchback, and I have owned a few of them. Everything from comfort, driveability, looks, hatchback handy, and gas mileage is perfect. I would have paid more for it. Great car! VW deserves a pat on the back for this one.;Color, power, seats.;volkswagen_gti
09/29/2007;jburnette;The GTI is really a great car. The good outweighs the bad and the car is the first of many that I want to hang on to. My only real problem with the car is the many dash noises and some weird sounds that keep coming up from time to time. The quality of the interior is sound and not cheap plastic. I can't understand why this car makes sounds that seem not to be an easy fix. It seems so solid. Overall you won't be sorry. This cars gets tons of attention no matter where you go. The price is a bit high but it's really worth it. ;Seats and dash look great. 200 hp is a plus and it's a very sharp looking car from every aspect.;volkswagen_gti
09/06/2007;RWH;This car is incredible! It looks great and drives even better. I must have driven about 15 different cars before I decided on the GTI, and I am 100% satified with it. The acceleration, handling, and braking are all top notch. It feels like driving a car that costs 2x what the GTI costs. The seats are incredibly comfortable and offer excellent support for cornering and for long drives. The stereo rocks, and the displays and controls are well designed and easy to use.

Having been a long time VW owner (I currently own), I was happy to see the GTI is made in Germany. I've just made it past the break-in period, so I'm finally able to do some spirited driving and I couldn't be happier (well, AWD would have made this car perfect, but hey we can't have it all).

09/01/2007;Joel;This car drives and performs great, the fuel economy is excellent. I previously owned a MK4 GTi and it was a great car but this one is far better, good job VW.;Exterior and interior design, engine and smooth 6M tranny.;volkswagen_gti
08/27/2007;RJM;I've had the GTI for three months now and I can honestly say it's a blast to drive, and with four doors, it's very practical as well. This is my first manual transmission car in 18 years and I'm really enjoying shifting on my own again. The car has plenty of power and very little turbo lag. Build quality is excellent and I've had no issues with reliability. I was tempted to get a BMW 335i, but in Northern Virginia where I live it seems that every other car is a BMW 3 series so the GTI is a nice change and the price is extremely reasonable for what you get. ;Form fitting seats combined with a manual transmission makes you really feel in control. ;volkswagen_gti
08/25/2007;Kriss Mellor;"I owned my 2007 VW GTI for about 6 months and it's been in for repairs well over 2 months in total. The information center was defective. It took over a week to replace. Most serious problem could be related to the engine, transmission, turbo - don't yet know the source. The dealer can't identify the problem and VW tech support has been useless. Possibly related to heat, since it occurs most often when the temperature is high. As you step on the gas the car drops out of gear and will not respond. It feels like you are slamming on the brakes, according to my friend who was driving with me during one of these ""seizures"". This is a very serious safety issue. Car was bought back by the dealer.";It can really move, when it is running properly. A blast to drive.;volkswagen_gti
08/20/2007;HSJ;"Sure there are better-looking and sportier cars, but none can match the GTIs combination of good looks, great interiors, very sporty driving and great pricing. I have the manual base car, and the list of ""stuff"" that is standard is amazing: 10-speaker(!) kicker Monsoon audio, Bi-Xenon headlamps, Driver Information Display (with 2 awesome trip computers), auto up/down on all windows, heated power mirrors, lots of user-programmable features, steering wheel controls, sports front seats, power outlet in trunk, great ""mood"" lighting at night, map lights all around - list just goes on. I love the interior lighting at night. After this car, other non-luxury cars' interiors seem cheap.";"Looks, interiors, sportiness, acceleration, fuel efficiency (up to 33-36 mpg sometimes), cockpit lighting at night, superb quality materials all around. Supremely spacious and comfortable for my 6'1"" frame, unlike other sporty cars.";volkswagen_gti
08/16/2007;Paul;I like this car because it follows my driving moods. Sometimes, I just like to adjust the climate, put it in drive, turn on Sirius Disorder and drive it like a normal car. And it does this marvelously. When I do this, it's fairly easy to get 30 mpg or more (according to the car's computer). Sometimes, I like to pick my own gears, put the windows down and the sunroof back, crank up Alt Nation and strap a brick to my shoe. It handles this impressively as well. And will still get around 27 mpg. No matter how I feel like driving, this car just delivers a great drive. It looks and feels rock solid. There's little features VW doesn't even flaunt giving me the impression of attention to details.;DSG is brilliant! This dual-clutch automated manual tranny truly is the future of changing gears, if it proves to have a comparable lifespan. 2.0T is uber impressive. I'm a stickler for ergonomics and this car delivers. Everything is exactly where it should be and looks great being there.;volkswagen_gti
08/10/2007;OrangeBlood;This car is not only a speedy sport compact but a very comfortable car for around town driving as well as commuting. Don't get me wrong, I bought this car because it is flat out fun to drive but it also has tremendous gas mileage too. If you stay off the turbo, you can easily get 30 mpg on the freeway and 26 on the streets. I have driven a few tiptronic transmission cars but nothing that compares. Simply put the car in sport mode, grip the wheel and hold on, no turbo lag. I am a pretty tall guy, over 6' tall, but I can ride comfortably in any seat in the car. The color of the fahrenheit really polarizes folks. It is a love or hate thing but most people will tell you that this car is sharp.;2.0T engine is great, (look at the numbers, this car does not give up much from the R32 and weighs about 500lbs less), DSG gearbox, Xenon headlights are nice, gauges look good as does the entire interior, SAT radio, MP3 adapter, and the color is loud.;volkswagen_gti
08/09/2007;Lorraine;This car is great fun to drive. Sometimes I wish we did not have speed limits. I am an older woman, driving a bright red GTI manual. Loving it, simply loving it. It holds the road like no other. I had an Audi A4, 1997. That car was also manual. My GTI seems quicker,and equally great to drive. ;I love the lane shift blinker. Just tap and it blinks 3 times. For me this car has adequate storage. The floor mats are really nice. I have only used the rubber ones and I think they are great. I love having controls on the steering wheel at my finger tips.;volkswagen_gti
08/02/2007;VWGTI2007;The title explains it all, you don't want to stop driving it. This car is the perfect blend of performance, practicality and value. I think it sums it up to say that this car does everything well but not super. As I drive it more and more, I know I made the right choice to jump over to the VW GTI club from the Honda Family. I was very skeptical but so far the experience has been amazing. If you treat a car as a vehicle going from point A to point B, you might not appreciate what this car has to offer. If you treat driving as an experience, this is a must have. ;"Bi-Xenon headlights, dual zone climate control, headlight washers, multifunction computer display, 4- doors, DSG, 2.0T FSI engine, 18"" huffs, the hatch practicality, rear seat heat vents, heated seats.";volkswagen_gti

07/17/2007;Dan W;I've put almost 2000 m. on my GTI. The more I drive it, the more I like it. It's great fun. VW should be applauded for building a terrific car for reasonable $. There is really no competition for the GTI, except for its cousin, the Audi A3. The GTI is quick and handles great; it even sounds wonderful - similar to a Honda VTEC at high rpm and it has a low growl when you give it some gas at low rpm. The rest of the time, it's quiet, as it should be. The build quality is excellent, too. The Civic Si, is no match for the VW in every day driving. The VW has much more low/mid range torque. It's a joy to drive and the Civic would be a chore. And, the GTI's hatchback design is much more practical.;volkswagen_gti
07/16/2007;VWGTI2007;A practical sports car if there ever was one. Pros: great power, great room and comfort, lots of features. Cons: Some rattles, could use nicer radio display.;2.0T engine, DSG transmission, hatchback, Xenon headlights with washers.;volkswagen_gti
07/16/2007;GTIjunkie;This is the first VW I have ever owned and by far the greatest car I have ever had in my possession.The around town gas mileage has been about 26-28 mpg and 3 people are kind of cramped but the ride and handling make this vehicle shine. Long road trips have been a dream getting close to 460 miles on a full tank of premium gas. The dealer-only oil changes have been a little steep ($90 for the first and $170 for the second) but knowing that the car is handled correctly and will last me a long time has made it worth it. Knowing what I know now I would purchase this vehicle again and I love the looks I get from people watching me whiz by them. ;I love the feel of the leather seats the response of the handling when I take sharp turns & the hum of the engine. The GTI is much better to ride in w/ the windows down & the sunroof open. The convenience of the drop down back seat makes packing even the larger objects a simple task. ;volkswagen_gti
07/08/2007;scottincarmel;"My 07 4 door (pkg. 2, manual, 18"" Huffs with summer tires) now has 35K miles on it, and I have not had it back to the dealer for anything. I do my own oil changes (Mobil 1 0W40) etc. For the winter, I ran 16"" Michelin Pilot Alpin PA2 winter tires, which made this car unstoppable, very impressive.

07/05/2007;richpa;This is the 3rd VW I've owned in a row and the second GTI I've owned. This is head and shoulders better than my last GTI, and I loved that car! In terms of performance, it's a blast to drive, has great power, hardly any turbo lag, great handling. Inside it is beautiful, the seats are really comfortable, the stereo is good (not great), the materials and fit and finish are first rate. I have 6000 miles on it so far and it is running great, averaging about 28.5 mpg so far using premium gas. The 4 door has surprising room in the back for passengers and I keep getting comments from people about how attractive the front end of the car is. Sweet looking 18 inch rims as well.

06/28/2007;TwoLabs;What a nice surprise the GTI has been. I have never really noticed the GTI before, but ended up buying one. I am very satisfied so far. Only 250 miles, but it is hard to stop driving. The power is fantastic and the overall feel in the cabin is comfortable. I have the 4 door and I was surprised with the ample legroom. No complaints at all. Just a fun, comfortable rocket ship with many amenities to enjoy. ;Acceleration, stereo is very good with a ton of bass, Sirius radio, lumbar seats, Xenon lights, signal lights on side mirrors, sunroof, heated seats, red cabin lights at night.;volkswagen_gti
06/26/2007;Mike;I did a lot of researching for my car and finally decided on the GTI. I wanted something fuel efficient, cool looking, fast, but not too pricey. Compared to any Honda (Civic, Accord), Mazda (3), Mini Cooper and Audi (A3), this car by far took the cake. Some of the best handling I've ever experienced. This is an extremely fun and fast car which has a very subtle look about it, but shines when you'd like it to. VW may not be on peoples' radar for amazing cars, but the GTI has my full backing 100%. This is easily the best investment I've ever made. ;The interior old school plaid seats are awesome. They really look good as opposed to the leather. The in dash lights are also really cool to stare at. The overall look of the car is simply stunning.;volkswagen_gti
06/16/2007;Nederland;This car is a successful compromise, a sporty, thrifty, fun, unique, practical car. Very quick, fuel efficient (I'm doing a little better than the listed EPA), decent rear seat, plush, unique, racy, versatile. What's not to like? The car gets lots of looks. The orange is a love/hate thing, but everyone has strong feelings. This would be a bad choice for a shy introvert. This car is front and center, and was designed to be noticed.;This is the only automatic transmission I'd ever buy. The best of all worlds. Throaty growl gets me going when I put my foot into it. Handles well, brakes are excellent. Safety features are first rate. Use Launch control with caution. Otherwise, you won't keep your license for long.;volkswagen_gti
06/06/2007;Willie J;This is one great vehicle. It has great handling, excellent pick up and go, awesome power too! The ride is a little harsh for my taste, but the tires make the handling that much better. The fuel economy is great too for a car like this, about 25 mpg in mixed driving. Decent cargo in the back too, my golf clubs can fit back there! Rear seat room is good also for adults, as long as they're not too tall. Comfortable seats, even though I don't understand why the lumbar support is the only power operation. Pretty good base stereo. There is a blind spot over the right shoulder that can be aggravating on the highways.;DSG transmission, sunroof, if the front wipers are on and you put the car in reverse the rear wiper will wipe once for easier view. Standard SAT radio, 6 disk CD changer that's in the dash and not in the glovebox or cargo area.;volkswagen_gti
06/04/2007;fhohio;I decided to purchase the GTI because it is a great combination of performance, practicality, and value. The engine pulls strongly into triple-digit speeds, the handling on the 17 inch rims all season tires is good, though if pushed it displays typical front wheel drive understeer. The ride is firm but not punishing, and the fit and finish are difficult to fault. Fuel mileage has been quite good. Only complaint has been a gear noise while parked with the transmission in neutral, but this seems to be unusual, and has not affected operation one bit.;Overall performance, practical features, gas mileage, fit and finish.;volkswagen_gti
06/04/2007;mapssi;Driving my GTI is a pure pleasure! Especially after I chipped it with APR. I now have 252 HP and 303 lb of torque! You can get more then 300 hp with just some basic modes. The ride is a little stiff at highway speeds, however if I have the family (2+2) with me the ride is better. I have the 4 door so it is much more practical then 2 doors. I notice that some body seams are wider then others (especially the hatch door seams) but over all, I LOVE it!!;6 speed manual, seats, standard features, fun to drive, bang for the buck!;volkswagen_gti
06/02/2007;Veedubliger;Traded my RX-8 for it and don't regret my decision. It feels good to be back in the VW family. Missed owning a Veedub but the new GTI was worth the wait. It is a fun little car. It is easy to drive fast with all the torque. I keep having to remind myself that I don't have to rev the hell out of it like the RX-8. It has a top-notch interior and cool exterior looks. ;The torque and neutral handling are definitely at the top of the list. I also love the plaid seats (I had to get the plaid).;volkswagen_gti
06/01/2007;Jaycee;The GTI is a stronger, more comfortable, has a classier interior, and just an all around better car than the Si. Don't believe me? Test drive the Si and GTI back to back and tell me what you think. Everything about the car makes it so special: xenon lamps, original GTI styled seats, responsive clutch, intricate buttons and lights, roomy backseat, 60/40 rear folding seats, 6 cd changer with premium sound (product of Bose), free 3 month satellite radio subscription, mpg counter, miles till refuel counter, rear AC, in dash computer menu, and definitely the large amount of torque. I was also surprised when I received my Fast yesterday in the mail. ;Torque! The overall driving experience is too much to describe. I also like it when other GTI drivers honk and wave. ;volkswagen_gti
05/30/2007;Californian;"This car is brand new, so I don't yet know about mileage and reliability. However the EPA figures are fine and everything works. There are no rattles. What a fantastic little car! It looks great inside and out, handles well and has excellent power. I chose a white, two-door six speed with a sunroof and leather. It also has the built-in Sirius radio. The DSG transmission would also be a good choice. I have the 18"" wheels with aggressive tires. The ride would be a bit better with the all-seasons. Sure, the GTI is not exactly inexpensive, but it's a lot of car for the money. I looked at and drove a lot of cars, including the Mazdaspeed 3, and the GTI was for me.";Turbo, handling, styling.;volkswagen_gti
05/30/2007;Jetta Upgrade;I have put the first 500 miles on my GTI and so far I am very happy with it. The car drives extremely well; a lot of pick-up and very smooth gear changes. The ride is a little stiff, especially on city streets, but not prohibitive. I don't have any problems with rattles or the radio, which I think sounds great! My only complaints are the iPod adapter - not super user friendly. The seats could be more adjustable - I am petite. It could use more storage space in the armrest and the price of premium gas. But overall, it is fun to drive, and it feels safe on the road and quite luxurious. ;volkswagen_gti

Other than that it has been great, good power and handling, great ride, nice, thoughtful features, though with room for improvement. The radio is great, as are the seats, front and rear. The power is nice, though there is a bit of torque steer. The DSG gearbox works best if you let it do it?s thing. Sport mode is best for hills when engine braking is needed. Incredible brakes.

05/22/2007;Dave;I got out of my lease 2 years early with my Acura RSX due to technical issues with the suspension. Yes it cost me nearly $4,000 to get out of my lease but it was WELL worth getting this GTI. It is stylish in and out, comfortable and most of all FUN to drive!!!

05/19/2007;ECONROY;"You don't see a bunch of these on the road, probably because the price is above others in this class. But for those who enjoy driving and want the utility of a hatchback and a small car that zips in and out of tight spaces, this car fills the bill and then some. My wife says it has ""scootability"". Ignore stats on power and weight. This 200 HP turbo MOVES this car and you feel it. We got package #2 with leather in tornado red. Yesterday we got a Pioneer AVIC- Z2 with nav and music hard drive installed and component speakers. For under $30,000 we've put together a car my wife and I hate to get out of.

The performance is all around. Great kick starting at about 2k rpms. I average around 30 mpg. The cabin is quiet with the windows up. You only hear the engine when you really push it. I myself have experienced no rattles up to now. Seats hold you in place but the bolstering also makes it hard to get out. Brake pedal feel is a little too soft for me. Ride is a little harsh, but its a sport tuned suspension, it's expected. I do have a problem with the radio. Bass erratically jumps up really high.

05/08/2007;Justin;I have been fixated on an Audi A3 since I saw them in Europe, and when I found out that they were coming to the states I had to have one, that is until I drove the GTI. The A3 was a little too refined for my taste, granted it is luxurious but it seems like a car that is easy to forget. The GTI however has all the classic makings of the cult phenomenon seen in the previous model, sure it's got a bit of wind noise (way less than previous gen), but if you had too much insulation you wouldnt be able to hear the growl of the exhaust... and if you have ever ridden in a tuned classic beetle you know it's almost deafening but fun as hell. They made a great modern performance platform and kept the VW soul.;Sirius radio, steering wheel mounted computer and radio controls, mute button for radio, DSG, paddle shift, growl of exhaust, T U R B O, the look on the faces of Mustang boys when a Vee Dub hatch flies past em.;volkswagen_gti
05/03/2007;Back to a VW again;We traded in our 2002 Jetta 1.8 turbo for a PT Cruiser GT. We missed the VW performanace after the deal was done. Three years later we sold the PT and purchased a GTI with DSG. We put 1100 miles on it before we took it on a trip to Calif from Wa State. The GTI was a pleasure on the whole trip. Plenty of power, cornered well and we got 29.5 MPG on our 2500 mile trip. This car was well worth the investment. I tried to buy a bra for the trip but they don't make one yet, however after returning home and scrubbing the car I was delighted that there was not one chip on the front end (nice design ). Try one and you will be sold. ;"Turbo power and DSG. Leather pkg and dual heating and air controls for both passengers. 18"" wheels were worth it!";volkswagen_gti
05/03/2007;Lollybug;"Since I was a teenager I drove an '84 VW Scirocco. Later in life, for work related reasons I needed a 4X4 so I got a Liberty (mistake!) and parked my VW for restoration. I've missed it ever since. Nothing drives like a VW and never more has this been true than with their new 2007 GTI. In the short time I've had it, it's earned the title of ""Car of the Year"" to me. Performance is top-notch, the styling and interior is beautiful"; it has the feel of a much more expensive auto. It's solid on the road and sticks to it when taking corners. You feel safe, secure, and you know you're getting value for your money. The 2007 GTI gets fabulous gas mileage and has actually brought fun back to the daily commute.;volkswagen_gti
04/27/2007;Murray;Ordered my GTI to get all the features I desired (took 4 months from order to delivery). The GTI is a joy to drive. DSG transmission is flawless. Switches and controls feel particularly solid. Experience only minor turbo lag (when engine accelerates from less than ~2000 rpm). Above 2000 rpm you feel like you're in a rocket! While car can take regular gas, performance is clearly enhanced with premium. After 1200 miles, getting 26-27 mpg for mostly highway driving (75-80 mph). Car is very quiet at speed. Optional 17 inch low profile all season tires are significantly less stiff than the summer tires. Excellent integration of radio and nav system with instrument panel display. ;DSG transmission with option for fully automatic, automatic with sport mode or manual control with paddle shifters. Get good gas mileage while allowing rapid acceleration when needed. Multifunction display between gauges with steering wheel controls for radio and MFD keep your eyes on the road. ;volkswagen_gti
04/23/2007;myjoiseygti;I wanted to trade down from a Passat and was interested a sport hatch. Looked at Mini Cooper, Mazda3 5 door and Audi A3 as well as Acura TSX. The GTI 5 door is the A3 without the steep price tag and the roof-length sunroof. This car is tremendous value. If you want leather, you'll pay about the same as you would for the Acura. Stick to the traditional plaid cloth, it's not only retro, it's comfortable and durable.;DSG, turbo, supportive front seats, grip when cornering, maneuverability in parking lots. Formula 1 steering wheel with paddle shifts is real cool. ;volkswagen_gti
04/21/2007;Briiga Eichstaedt;"As a German, I am very particular about my cars. Though I do not automatically dismiss non-German cars, I prefer the ride and fun of the German auto. This VW is no exception. I love how it was made in Wolfsburg, Germany. The styling is great. It is a complete blast to drive. I wish the Americans would build an Autobahn! I am short but have tall family and friends. They all fit in with no problem. The four door is great, and I can fit so much cargo in the trunk. I love the 18"" wheels with the red brake callipers and adore the red stripe on the grill. If you live in a state that requires two license plates I recommend forego the front one. Looks much better!";Sporty ride - sport mode is heaven. Red accents, drive feel, amazing engine and power, styling, the leather seats are very good grip. Also, the cup holders are perfect size even in America! Great stereo system. OH! The latch to open the hatch is so cool! It is the VW badge that flips up! Love!;volkswagen_gti
04/12/2007;heat;I initially went just to see what the hype was about and fell in love after the test drive. I was going to look at the Civic Si, but didn't even get out of the VW place with out the car. Took the one off the show room floor, #269 out of 1200. The car is really fun to drive. The seats are really comfortable. This is my first VW and definitely won't be my last. The DSG auto trans is really fun to play with when you want to do just that... play! I actually look forward to driving again.;I love the Orange color. The DSG trans. The tons of power on tap. Really comfortable seats. Really fun car to drive.;volkswagen_gti
04/10/2007;Carboy;The best car I have ever driven, I have driven a lot of the hatchbacks but none are as fun as the GTI to drive. The DSG is a very nice transmission that adds to the great performance of the car. The car that compares the closest to the GTI would be the Audi A3.;DSG, plaid seats (interlagos), engine(!), and the sound of the car.;volkswagen_gti
04/09/2007;BurntGauge;At first I was a bit scared to get a FWD, turbo, German car. But I'm convinced that this truly is the Car of the Year. It's just so well balanced, well made, fun to drive, loaded with features, and affordable. There's nothing to hate perhaps except that you can't drift with it as easy as you'd like... but I can get over that easy.;The engine is phenomenal. With torque coming on at 1800 rpms you never feel like you're out of boost.;volkswagen_gti
04/07/2007;Babs;This car is NOT what I expected. Lots of wind noise drowning out the nice stereo system. Creaks, rattles and groans (mine). This car is going back to the dealer and some other fool can try and enjoy its poor build quality.;Engine and trans.;volkswagen_gti
04/02/2007;PTown GTI;I have had this car since Nov. It is everything that I hoped for and more. A real pleasure to drive on the twisties, and around town to work. I was down to either this or the Audi A3, which has worse ergonomics, worse visibility - but cool sunroof. Glad that I went with the VW. A few rattles here and there, but I am really particular, so take that with stride. The summer tires that come with the car are just that - poor once the weather cools off. The 6 speed manual is AMAZING - why someone would go for the DSG is beyond me. Highly recommended!!;"Amazing to drive, with a sleeper body that does not stand out. Very fast and quick, great handling. The optional 18"" Hufs are beautiful wheels. ";volkswagen_gti
03/09/2007;NL;I've been for service ten times already in five months. Granted, everything is covered under warranty, but the hassle of coming in for burnt out LED's, airbag lights, wind noise, ticking sounds, immobilizer malfunctions, radio, squeaks and rattles (and I mean a lot!)... etc is really annoying. Also, I never imagined that a car like this would have so many design quirks. I can't name them all, I only have 250 words left. To paraphrase, you'll waste a lot of gas, a lot of tires, a lot of windshield washer fluid, a lot of your time and a lot of your money to fix problems. When I first received my car I had two scratches on the door and center console, and glue all over the inside of the roof.;When running well it is very smooth. It has a good sound system and all of the buttons are intuitive. ;volkswagen_gti
03/07/2007;Chris;First of all, to be honest I never thought I would own a VW. I went and test drove an '07 Civic Si, but found it to be lacking in the torque department. I also considered the Scion tC but found it to be lacking the quality of the Toyotas that I have owned before. When I first test drove the GTI I was surprised by how smooth and refined the power was. It doesn't require you to downshift every time you need to pass since it makes so much torque and at such low rpm. There is NO lag that I can tell. The cabin is well organized, being driver oriented with most features that I wanted being standard. The car is also very quiet with a supple ride for a sports car, paired with a responsive steering system.;The absence of torque steer that ruins most powerful FWD cars, the Audi looks with the high quality interior, and the red stripe on the front with the red brake calipers behind the 18' wheels. I also like the simple but functional dash. The FSI paired with the turbo also seems to be perfect.;volkswagen_gti
02/23/2007;JR;I have only owned my GTI for three days now but I am really enjoying it. I was not a huge fan of VWs before my wife wanted to go look at them when we seen this car and drove it I had to have it. I first thought what am I doing dropping this much money on a 2-door hatchback but after driving it more and feeling the performance this little thing has it is worth it. If you are thinking of looking at one drive it before you look at the sticker price.;My favorite features are the 200hp engine, the decent gas mileage, the 6 speed auto trans mission with shifting paddles on the steering wheel, and the speed / handling of this little beauty. ;volkswagen_gti
02/09/2007;Adam;"My first two cars were purchases that I could afford. This car was a ""desire"" and a nice treat to myself. It has fantastic pickup, a great transmission, and a beautiful VW interior. It gets good gas mileage for a sporty car. It handles very nicely. The sport suspension took some time to get used to after driving two floaty cars prior to this one. The hatchback is very practical, despite American's typical disdain of them. My mother has owned 11 VWs with very few reliability problems and they are extremely safe. My brother was in a head on collision in a '98 Jetta going 65 mph. He literally walked away with no injuries. This alone is a reason to buy VW.";I love the plaid seats, DSG transmission, Sirius satellite radio, 6 disc in-dash CD player, and iPod jack. This car has a quality interior and it is far more stylish than Japanese models.;volkswagen_gti
02/04/2007;mheins57;After I test drove it, I canceled my other test drives and bought the GTI. Mine is actually a 2006.5, but it has the same features as the 2007 model. I love almost everything about it, especially its power. I opted for the manual transmission because I like the feel of shifting myself. the clutch and shifter are very smooth. The interior design seems well thought out, and has lots of nice little extra features I never got in my American cars. It is relatively quiet for a little car. It has really brought back the pleasure of driving for me, which I thought I had lost.;The power and responsiveness. The hatchback is very handy. I appreciate the built-in compass and trip computer features. It gets respectable gas mileage for a performance car. I got 29 mpg on two long road trips driving 80-85 mph.;volkswagen_gti
01/25/2007;ndccpf1;I looked at the Audi A3 (have an A4 also) but for the money VW gave you MUCH more and was more sporty. The GTI's engine is GREAT! And... it has CLOTH seats! Hurray! When will the USA market realize leather is NOT what everybody wants. I want other features in a car, but don't force me to take leather to get them! AND...hatchbacks are great!;The speed sensing wipers, reverse gear activated wiper, super engine response (non-chipped), ergonomics and comfort, and safety features abound!;volkswagen_gti
01/23/2007;detective40oz;I took delivery of mine this month. So far the car has been a pleasure to drive. From the subtle sporty looks to the refined interior this is a fun and practical car to drive. I'm never disappointed in the acceleration and having owned a 2003 GTI I can say this car is miles ahead of it in every category especially the handling! Simply put the 2007 GTI is more car than you would expect to get for $23,000.;The bi-xenon headlights, iPod jack, glove compartment cooler, red brake calipers, indirect vent, plaid seats, and four doors!;volkswagen_gti
01/16/2007;jburnette;I always wanted this car. I feels very solid, fast, and sporty. This car gets tons of attention no matter where you go. It is much more solid then the Honda I traded in for it. I love it.;Everything, but most of all the fast, smooth feel.;volkswagen_gti
01/15/2007;GTI;After taking my car for a test drive, I was hooked. I felt like the little boy on the BMW add...I just had to have it! I was still supposed to shop around and look at all the other types of cars too, but never did. This car is very exciting stuff! Take it for a test drive, you`ll love it!;The DGS transmission, I just cant stop playing with it! fast gear changes! It is awesome!;volkswagen_gti
01/09/2007;tincup33;I own a 2003 Cobra so I'm used to a fast car. I was surprised by the GTI's ability to just get up and go. Its handling is awesome and the design is very eye catching. We got rid of our Xterra to save on gas but it's hard not to get on it everywhere you go. I turned my wife onto this car and I'm glad I did, she was going to get a Rabbit. ;Everything;volkswagen_gti
01/08/2007;RoadkillPDX;"I was a salesman at a Chevy dealership. I was looking for a fun-to-drive rig with aftermarket potential. I test drove many cars (Tiburon, Civic Si, Cobalt SS, Scion tC), but fell in lust with the ease of control, drivability, and the ""oomph factor"" that's found in turbocharged cars. This car may look like the Rabbit, with the exception of the sinister red grin on the grill, but underneath the cute exterior lies the quick-revving, adrenaline pumping, heart of an import-killing beast. The GTI is heavier than before (almost twice the weight of the A1 body), but with a power-to-weight ratio that puts many more expensive rigs to shame. Plus the car has almost no turbo lag. VW rocks! ";The Sport setting on the shift is great for off-the-line launching, but the most rockin' feature has to be the DSG paddles on the wheel. Tap up and 8 milliseconds later, you're in the next gear. It makes a stick shift seem weak.;volkswagen_gti
12/29/2006;Josh;The GTI is really fast. I don't think there is any Honda in the same class that can be a match for the MkV GTI. Even the S2000 only has 40hp more, but 50lb/ft less than the GTI. It's the best purchase I've ever made.;The power and sport tuned suspension.;volkswagen_gti
12/26/2006;seminole_kev;This is a very nice car. It is a good blend of sport and comfort in the typical European fashion. It offers lots of nice features as well.;The 2.0T engine is very nice. It has lots of low-end torque and a flexible power band. The DSG transmission is amazing - this coming from a traditional manual transmission driver. The suspension is a good mix of sport and comfort, this car doesn't crash over bumps. The seats are very supportive, yet comfortable.;volkswagen_gti
12/21/2006;Yurx Cherri;This car is amazing. German engineers managed to combine exceptional dynamics and speed with very frugal fuel consumption. You will be shocked if you compare the interior room parameters with BMW X3. They are almost the same. On the top of that you are basically buying Audi A3 (a bit shorter) for about $5,000 less.;The DSG transmission.;volkswagen_gti
12/20/2006;J.S. Sumner;My son and I test drove eight different cars in the $20,000 to $25,000 price range and we both felt that hands down, the 4-door GTI was the winner. Many auto magazines felt the same. The quality inside and out, the safety (me), and the performance (him) won us over. I have owned German performance cars and this GTI has many of those factors. The DSG transmission is a major advancement in performance and to be in a car at this price point is hard to believe. Graduation from college has come and gone and this GTI will be with my son for many fun filled and safe years to come.;The DSG transmission, interior quality, performance, in and out of car lighting (gauges and headlights).;volkswagen_gti
12/15/2006;patrick lancaster;I have owned this car for a month now and it was definitely worth the hassle and wait. Four doors are a must. It has awesome power and handling!;The power!;volkswagen_gti
12/09/2006;chris;I have had a GTI for many years, including the MKIV and recently the MKV. The 2.0T motor is extremely powerful, much more so than the 1.8T was. The DSG transmission makes a world of difference. ;The DSG transmission, 2.0T motor, suspension, exhaust note, and excellent interior fit and finish.;volkswagen_gti
12/08/2006;George;I intended to purchase a Mini Cooper S, but after driving he GTI I was sold that this was the car for me. I was looking for small and fun to drive vehicle and I made the right decision. The longer I own it, the more I appreciate the GTI's quality. I only wish it came with 4 wheel drive. ;The DSG transmission, power, and excellent storage in the rear.;volkswagen_gti
11/29/2006;david gorospe;I've had other GTIs, a VR6 and a 1.8T. This MK5 by far is the best of them all. It has great torque, handling and comfort. The interior looks way more expensive than the competition. It is fun to drive. I added a new suspension and a chip. They make it handle and go even better. This car might cost a little bit more compared to Honda, Mini, others, but you have to pay for all the same extras that comes with the GTI. For real everyday driving this has the best overall, you will still love this car even after five or more years, think about that! My good friends that drive Fords and Acuras test drove my car and the absolutely loved it!;The never ending torque at 2,000-6,000 rpms. Great handling.;volkswagen_gti
11/25/2006;Mandi Terry;This car has been great for the short time I have owned it. I plan on owning it, until it falls apart. The first day I drove the car home, I hit a huge rabbit and it broke my fog light bulb. It scared the heck out of me, my first new car and I already killed an animal. I hope I never hit another animal for as long as I own the car. ;"The Turbo with automatic transmission, satellite radio, and 17"" rims.";volkswagen_gti
11/23/2006;Dennis from NY;Over the past five years I have had a total of six VW/Audi vehicles, including a 2001 GTI 1.8 Manual and a 2005 Audi A4 1.8 manual and this car blows them all away! I test drove the new A4 2.0T, as well as the Infiniti G35, and the new BMW 328xi which all are sweet, fun and capable cars however the GTI just came out even or ahead in most of the categories that are important. My decision came down to the GTI 4dr and the BMW 328xi and for the extra $17,000 for the Bimmer the decision was very easy, take the GTI and save a ton of money! The build quality is fantastic, the interior is high quality and comfortable, the car handles fantastically, the engine is extremely smooth. this car is very practical and fun!;The car is sweet. I like the smooth engine, and the manual is also much smoother than the previous models. The Interior is fantastic and comfortable, I love the plaid cloth seats! This car just begs to be driven, I have over 3,000 miles and have only owned it a month! The 4 door version looks sweet and is practical.;volkswagen_gti
11/20/2006;soccerref9;This car is not only a true driver's car but is also refined and comfortable for a long distance drive. It's moderate pricing sets it apart from more expensive cars such as a BMW or Audi. Long term quality has in the past been an issue, but in my initial 5,000 miles and 7 weeks of ownership, I have not seen any problems.;The engine and 6-speed manual transmission are a true pleasure. The flat torque curve allows power to kick in early. The leather seats are comfortable with the lumbar support. The hatch offers the ability to carry large items for such a small car. The handling and breaking are excellent.;volkswagen_gti
08/15/2009;Richard;This car has been great no problems with anything Local Dealer is great for oil changes ;Hard Top Conv;volkswagen_eos
08/07/2009;Steven Scholla;Gas lid broke, fuel sensors, folding top mishaps, windows go up & down repeatedly for no reason. paint scrapped up on rear folding roof, roof won't fully set on car body, sounds like a rattle trap, gas & brake peddle to close;Fun to drive, acceleration, handling;volkswagen_eos
07/09/2009;jws6;I bought the eos for my wife for mothers day! What a mistake! My wife likes the concept but the car burns a ton of oil. They have been doing the weight test and claims its within vw specs but we have to add oil every week its crazy and a very common problem with all of these cars! The other MAJOR issue is water. The car leaks water badly and smells like MOLD all the time. I have brought it back 3 times now and they have replaced all the carpet and it is still a problem. last weekend my wife took her sneakers out of the trunk and they were soaked and her gym shorts we could ring the water out of them and the car smells like mold AGAIN. Ive contacted my lawyer!;convertible and that works fine, no problems with the mechanics.;volkswagen_eos
06/15/2009;love it but;I bought my EOS used, it had around 8,000 miles on it. It has been a blast to drive. I have had an issue with the top. The sunroof will periodically stay open when I close the top. The dealer had a very difficult time diagnosing. They think they have fixed it but not so sure. The back seat is too small for adults to travel comfortably but I did not buy it for passengers. This is my main transportation on a daily basis and I love it. I get approx 28mpg with combo of highway/city commute so can't complain.;Hard top convertible of course and sun roof is a great feature for the extra light allowed. ;volkswagen_eos
04/08/2009;sanderson32;"How do you spell fun? E-O-S. Purchased this in Dec of 06, and drive 30K annually. I've had a set of tires, one engine recall (that fixed a ""check engine"" light), and a top adjustment. That's it - other than oil changes. My 13-year old son is waiting for the day he gets this car as a hand-me-down! Tons of fun, great handling, and reliable - what more do you need? ";Responsive engine, great stereo, handling;volkswagen_eos
03/24/2009;Eos Guy - Illinois;My first VW and convertible. Both have been a great experience. Fun with the top up or down. Wish it had all wheel drive (sometimes);The power top and cornering lights.;volkswagen_eos
01/29/2009;Ecartman1964;The EOS is a beautiful car and it has great performance and outstanding gas mileage. It ends there. Serious problems with engine, it burns oil, and leaks a little. I would not suggest this vehicle because I had it break down twice (only driven it 8,000 miles in the last year) and towed. Service is horrible because one must wait for a few days before they can even look at it and start the repairs. I'll never buy another VW again and will migrate over to Lexus, Infinity, or Acura. ;Fun to drive, great stereo, performance is awesomw, and got 32 mpg.;volkswagen_eos
01/06/2009;copout;"After having a 2005 PT Cruiser convertible and using it as a field vehicle, it was time for a ""new car"". My cruiser was mechanically sound but in pretty rough shape. With few convertible choices that a state worker can afford, I ran across a used EOS with a little over 20000 miles on the warranty left, yes the 07's had a 5000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. New ones do not. It's a silver essence with a black interior, the black interior is hard to find as most have the beige, for a less than tidy person do not get the beige. The hard roof system while opening makes the car look like a transformer and will get you lots of looks. After 1500 miles in 2 weeks, no problems. LOVE IT. ";"Retractable hard top. Fit and finish. My ""new"" Eos is a blast to drive and has plenty of power with its over 4000 lbs. of weight. It seems like I'm getting about 30 MPG. The heated seats have come in handy even in Florida, I did not think I would need them, you do, its my favorite at this point.";volkswagen_eos
11/30/2008;Steve Myers;SUPER car! Glad I waited 60 years to have one come along. Exceptional craftsmanship everywhere. Eye candy for onlookers. DSG tranny captured this stick shift perfectionist. It FEELS safe. Gas mileage runs from ca. 26 in town to 34.5 on the road. Snazzy and snappy. Survives car washes without a leak. Thunderstorms, too! Local cop follows me around, licking its chops. I behave. Only negative: no Autobahn nearby. Oh, for about 50 km of German road and no speed limits. (Might be worth a trip someday....) ;DSG tranny, super radio, torque, color (Thunder Blue/Cornsilk leather interior).;volkswagen_eos
10/24/2008;David Stieg;I love the EOS since the day I have purchased it. Get great gas mileage, normal is 33 to 35 mpg. Compared to other hard top convertibles this is the best buy fo the price. Only issue is the top fails all the time, I have to take it to the dealership and have them do an adjustment to the cable to make it go down. Dealer says after 12,000 miles i have to pay to get it fixed which is silly for a convertible. the first time i get it but the third time is a pain. If you buy this car make sure your dealer cover this for at least the full length of the warranty. No bluetooth on this vehicle was a poor design and need to have the factory reset the engine light with every 5000 mile oil change is bad;Best feature is the trunk space with then top down and the iPod capability through the CD player ;volkswagen_eos
10/05/2006;grandlapaloma;After a thorough search for the next generation convertible. We traded our beloved 2001 VW Cabrio for the EOS. It does not have a soft top. Don't buy a soft top convertible, period. This multi-function hard top sportster convertible is everything true engineering can offer. We bought the base with the upgraded auto/shift transmission and satellite radio. It was tough to get since supplies are low, wait for it. We tested every car within a $10,000 range of the base price of EOS and its still the best value at full MSRP. The fit and finish, engine, gas mileage, quality, etc make this the best every day car or weekend blaster. ;The hard top and the use of a moonroof when the top is up or when it rains in Phoenix, which is maybe, mmmmmm, two days a year.;volkswagen_eos
10/03/2006;auctionking;I recently purchased a VW Eos with nearly a thousand miles clocked. The car has outporfomed beyond my expectation. I have owned over 30 cars in my life. The excitment can only be compared when you first got your license and your father let you driwe. The Eos has personality. It is low key, not flashy. It has quality that you see touch. It is eager to please with its smooth ride. It saves you thousands of dollars over other cars. It has the spacious comfort of a four passanger car. ;I like how the instrument panel is not complicated. The stereo is incredible. The seats are comfortable and elegant. The engine is powerful and smooth. There is no vibration or wind noise. ;volkswagen_eos
09/28/2006;Gabriel Palotas;The word conventinal does not apply to this car. Elegant styling, quality workmanship in all details. Finally a car that gives you value, satisfaction. I have compared and toiled over the last couple of weeks in purchasing a hardtop convertable and was prepared to pay well over the price of this car. The comfortable four passanger seats are unmatched in the hardtop convertable class. The motor is peppy and economical. I turned in my M45 Infinity V8 with joy. I have not given up on luxury.The leather interior and smart easy controls spell SMART.;Hard top Convertable,Design,Smooth Quiet Ride,Energetic fuel saving 4 cylinder Turbo Engine ;volkswagen_eos
09/20/2006;ohiodoc;HI have owned this car for a month and can not get over how much fun it is to drive. I drive 60 miles per day to and from work, already have over 1,500 miles, and its still as fun to drive as the day I brought it home. The handling is great on both wet and dry roads. The convertable top is a great show piece and conversation starter. The acceleration is fantastic and it feels even at 80 mph that the car has a lot more to give. I have been getting wonderful gas milage to at around 30-32 mpg on the highway. The car looks and acts like an Audi but is $10,000 less and has a hard not a soft top, which is great for Ohio weather. ;"Two outstanding features: 1. the steering whel mounted controls for the radio. 2. Good head room. Being 6'6"" this was a absolute neccesity that is seldom found on small sporty touring cars.";volkswagen_eos
09/19/2006;Jerry;This is an absolutely amazing vehicle! It has a much better ride and more interior room than the Lexus SC430. The top retracts QUICKLY! Also, it is a very quick car - surprisingly so. It has an amazing transmission with smooth power delivery. WOW!;The integrated power sunroof.;volkswagen_eos
09/12/2006;batmanlasd;I love the gas mileage that my Eos gets. I love the style, too. I haven't passed the recommend 600 miles to fully step on pedal yet. I get lots of complements about it. I like how it is built in Europe. It has a very smooth ride, I hardly feel the bumps. I love the fact that the horn is not va VW sound.;The ability to got topless or with the sunroof. The display in front of you. I like how the window rolls down a bit before you open the doow. I also like the Thunder Blue color.;volkswagen_eos
09/11/2006;rick;I have been waiting for this one ever since the concept previewed in the auto shows. Last week, I grabbed one of only seven allotted to the dealer until later this year (maybe). The other dealer in town only had five. On my first drive to the bay area, I had three compliments while waiting to pay the bridge toll! Plan on spending about $36,000 out the door on the basic model with the auto stick and about $40,000 for the Sport/Luxury model. The car is quick, rides very quiet with roof down, has great steering, and the 17 inch wheels really help dampen road bump noise. It has a great sunroof too! The standard sound system is plenty and I got 31 mpg on my first tank of gas. All in all, this is a great car! ;This car has the perfect size and configuration of controls in front for easy reach while driving. The auto stick is fun and great for mountain roads! It has plenty of trunk space for two rolling travel cases or a golf bag. The roof has to be the best feature and folks stop and wathch the show when activated, it's quick too! ;volkswagen_eos
09/06/2006;flheat;When I orginally was looking for a new car, I also considered the Volvo C70. This car drives so much better, the interior is more luxurious (very much like the Audi A4 cabriolet I traded in). My Eos is equipped the same as the Volvo is about $10,000 less. The design of the car continues to amaze me, from the sunroof, to the gymnasics the roof performs when it goes up and down. I got a manual and I think it pairs up better with the engine than the DSG.;The sunroof, aanual transmission, Audi-like feel, and beautiful navigation and dash layout.;volkswagen_eos
09/05/2006;LoveMyEOS;When a 20 year old male and his 50+ mother agree that a car is perfect;" it must be! Jerry, who reviewed thought the EOS was a ""male"" car. I disagree...it's just a sophisticated vehicle for either sex. I am not normally a spur of the moment type person, but once I saw the EOS with the top down and test drove it, I knew I HAD to put a deposit on it. Mine was the first off the dealer's lot. It's like owning entirely two different vechicles, one with top down and the other as a hardtop. More people than I can count in the past week have asked me about the car. It was a big hit in AC this past weekend. I have yet to find something that I would change about it from either a design or a performance point. I LOVE IT!";volkswagen_eos
09/02/2006;NEW VW EOS owner;I've just got my new EOS and I absolutely love it. Coming from the VW Beetle to a hardtop convertible with sunroof is such a luxury. It handles well. I have the sport pkg. with paddle gears...nice convenience. It certainly attracts a lot of looks. This is a car for both male and female drivers. It has nice style and nice pep. It is just a great convertible!;I have a black EOS with beige leather, it looks great. I like the dashboard information center. It is easy to read and program. The steering wheel buttons to control the dash info. as well as stereo system are very convenient and easy to use.;volkswagen_eos
08/31/2006;ED;"I could not agree more with the two previous reviews. I test drove the Volvo C70 and there is no comparison. The EOS is much better looking, has more features, is a lot quicker, and costs $12,000 - $15,000 less! I picked up my car on Saturday. It is blue with cream interior and the luxury package. The WOW effect when you lower the top in unbelievable. There is no appreciable cowl shake with the top down and with the top up it is extremely quiet. The back seat is very suitable for two adults, I had a 6' 8"" person in the back and could raise and lower the top with no problem. The ""feel"" of this car when you are driving is unbelievably solid and safe. I own two Lexus models and the build quality of the EOS is outstanding. This car is FUNTASTIC!";The hardtop convertible. The ability to carry four adults. The saftey features (pop-up roll bars). The dual controls for the a/c and heated seats. The sound system and all the little touches like snaps to hold your seat belts in place etc, etc. The TOTAL package is just outstanding. I really do like this car!;volkswagen_eos
08/28/2006;Jay;This is the greatest convertible ever! It feels just as solid as my 2006 GTI 2.0T. Go for the dynaudio and the sport package for the extra goodies!;The CSC roof and easy to close trunk lid.;volkswagen_eos
08/28/2006;cdgchi@earthlink.net;The Eos is a quick car, it accelerates smoothly. I haven't noticed any turbo lag, the power is there when you need it. It handles well and it doesn't wander when being driven.;This car is really fun to drive, the hard top always attracts a crowd.;volkswagen_eos
08/27/2006;eoslover;I bought my Eos yesterday and cannot stay out of it! I'm truly enjoying driving it. Top down or top up, it's a fun ride. ;I like the beautiful and comfortable leather seats, fully automatic convertible hardtop that can also become a sunroof, and steering wheel controls.;volkswagen_eos
08/22/2006;JERRY;"I've waited five years for a VW Hardtop Convertible that looks like a ""guy"" car. Mine is Black with 18"" wheels and has a really aggressive look to it. The car is flawless. Every time I retract the roof it draws a crowd. The roof, as I understand is not designed by VW, but by another company who specailizes in the Hard-top market, making roofs for Audi, Volvo and Mercedes. VW's is the only hard-top convertible that has a sunroof. This car is fast, numble, and most importantly - safe! I love this car. By the way, get the Sport Package. Being able to shift the gears with paddles on the steering wheel really makes this car drive like a sports car. ";"The paddle shifting, eye catching design, and the ability to configure it in different ways to make it look like a ""guy"" car without tasteless modifications or with different color/wheel options, making it more suitable for any demographic. I love getting 30+ MPG in a FAST car.";volkswagen_eos
08/20/2006;VWenthusiast;I just purchased an Eos. I was comparing it to the Pontiac G6 Convertible and the Chrysler Sebring. I must say, this is the best Convertible I have ever seen. It has great craftsmanship, is super fun to drive, and all at a price that is more than fair. I would have bought the car even if the dealership would had charged me $5,000 over sticker, which is common for the G6 Convertible. This is the best car I have ever had and I recommend it to anyone.;My favorite feature is the attention to detail that VW put into this car. It has excellent craftmanship on the interior and great lines on the exterior. The Pontiac Solstice in comparison is one of poorest cars in terms of craftmanship. ;volkswagen_eos
07/20/2008;Nicole;I had been looking for a convertible, however, I live in Maine, and they are not that feasible for 8 months out of the year. When I saw this car I had to have it. It's comfortable (even for 2 full grown adults) in the back seat. Very nicely built, drive is smooth. I have put 20,000 on it in less than a year and no problems so far. Also, I have the base model and comes with everything I want including leather and dual heat controls;Obviously the retractable hard top, stereo system, the interior lights on dash board;volkswagen_eos
07/01/2008;JP;Wife drives it most, she loves it. I wish it were a bit larger, but it is a compact. Found it has been needing one quart of oil every 1k, service says that is not unusual with a turbo. Seems like a lot. Overall good car and a good value.;sunroof-conv-top;volkswagen_eos
03/25/2008;David;Good sporty drive feel but not a true sport car feel. Back seat big enough for 1 small adult. Great top;" easy, quick, plus sunroof. Flaws: Poor traction or excessive torque on start up - front wheels easily spin. Bad tires (Goodyear Eagle LS-2) on my 17"" wheels. Tires easily ruined by normal potholes (at $200 each)and have poor traction. I replaced mine with a different and vastly better brand for $175 each. Rough transmission with lag on acceleration and when automatically upshifting. Noticeable surge when transmission downshifts. Recall on my 2.0T engine which VW didn't inform me of and won't provide info on. Ugly exterior rear end. Cheap looking interior plastic wood. ";volkswagen_eos
03/19/2008;Lisa;Not only is this car sexy, but it is so fun to drive! My husband is always looking for reasons why he has to drive it because he loves it too. We even put two car seats in the back. The wind isn't too much, it doesn't even mess up my hair on the way to work. Plus I'm always getting comments on how great it looks - it's great!! My only complaint is the trunk is heavy and hard to close - not a big deal, just annoying. The trunk space is reasonable for a convertible. I love the sunroof - it's not something I use because it's way too loud when open, but it's great to have the sunlight in the winter - convertibles can be dark when the top is closed - not this car!;The speed, handling and sun roof.;volkswagen_eos
03/13/2008;jmkober;I purchased my Eos, the 3.2 with sport package after driving the 2.0T. Gas mileage is about 24 MPG overall. Car is loads of fun to drive but is not as comfortable on long trips as I would have hoped. It has been in the shop 5 times in 5 months for a defective strut, rattle in doors (recall), broken lumbar motor and leaking. Car still rides rough. I don't understand it. I even swapped out the 18s for some Michelin 16s, no help. I am considering a trade in for the 2.0T without sport package as I love the looks. ;Top of course, auto volume control, auto wipers, heated seats, and fun to drive factor. ;volkswagen_eos
03/11/2008;Car Enthusiast;Having owned an array of cars in the past and having searched the market many times over for the perfect convertible, I can say that I hit the jackpot with the Eos. Great performance, amazing build quality, head-turning styling, affordable maintenance, good gas milage, versitile top styling, and all around fun car to drive. This is a must for both convertible enthusiast and those wanting a more practical coupe. The design of the front and rear wind screen is ingenious and in combination with the windows up and top down, you barely feel or hear wind noise. Drive it, experience it, and please don't wait to buy it!;Engineering features of the top, windscreens, and spacious lugage compartment. Great handling and more than adequate acceleration. Styling that rivals the best luxury cars. VW dependability and service. Well designed letherette interior. ;volkswagen_eos
03/02/2008;Robin;I've always had a rag top. I love this car, best of both worlds. Looks like a transformer when the top goes down. Careful, this little car is very fast. Quiet inside. Hope this red convertible doesn't get me a speeding ticket. ;My favorite feature has to be that folding top. It goes in the trunk in just 25 seconds. ;volkswagen_eos
03/01/2008;noodles;I love this car! After searching and driving everything convertible priced at $35k and below, this is by far the best. A Mustang GT can't touch the handling and gas mileage, it's overall shorter than a Chrysler Sebring but somehow roomier in the back. Better craftsman ship than ANY American made car in this price range and holds its resale! I got the auto/manual transmission with manual controls on the steering wheel. I feel like I'm flying a plane! Do your homework and test drive everything else before driving an Eos, because once you test drive you to will be hooked on the Eos!;Driving at night is so much fun! The blue and red interior lights really set it off at night. Very safe car for my 5 year old. They don't make many, so not everyone will be driving one. 9 speaker CD with iPod and 6 disc changer rocks!! The transmission controls on the steering wheel is great!;volkswagen_eos
01/15/2008;bayesian;"I love the Eos. At 5'11/ 170#/ 32-33"" inseam I fit fine, but if I were over about 6'1/ 34"" or seriously overweight (rather than slightly) I'd be running out of room. Seat comfort, support, adjustability range is excellent";" control layout mostly excellent. Not _that_ quiet with top up, but OK. Handling with Sport pkg (18"") is excellent - ride is firm but not uncomfortable. The 3.2 (which I didn't particularly want, but it was the only way to get Eismeer blue with sport suspension";volkswagen_eos
01/06/2008;vwjonathan;"I waited until the car had been out 6 months and got a 2.0 T in May 2007. The car is a head-turner, fun to drive, and gets better than 30 mpg on the highway. The ""wow"" factor on this car is a 10 - no other car in the world has a sunroof (panoramic) built into the convertible top. The completely hands-free operation of the top turns this stunning coupe into a sleek, topless car in about 20 seocnds. Even with the top down, there is pleny of room for overnight bags and a laptop. And believe it or not, you really get a back seat that fits adults. The car handles like a true sports car, has a great 50K mile warranty, and will make your neighbors jealous.";Panoramic sunroof, sirius satellite radio, cool violet dash lights, adjustable center console elbow rest, power drivers seat, great fuel economy, and way-too-cool styling.;volkswagen_eos
12/05/2007;JML;I love my Eos. I have always wanted a convertible and finally found one I fell in love with. I wanted a hard top but couldn't find one I really liked until know. It is an eye catcher. ;The top of course, that's why I bought it.;volkswagen_eos
12/05/2007;njpixie;I have owned this car since March. I live in Florida, loved the design and the way it drove. Started having problems in the first week with the wheel bearings, then the conv. top made a rattling noise, now I have water coming in from the weather stripping around the top. Also, the paint quality on volkswagens isn't good. Chips occur during driving very easily. Not very satisfied. Will not buy another volkswagen ever!!;Easy conv top, how it looks. Fun to drive, safety.;volkswagen_eos
10/28/2007;crisch;I love this convertible. It is just as gorgeous, fast, reliable as the other high priced cars out there! I was on the road and thought I saw another Eos, so I sped up to drive past it and take a look. It was an Audi... and looked so much like my VW. This car is so fun to drive, it's fast and I get lots of compliments on it. It handles well, turns easily and the best part is the fact that you have 3 cars in one. A coupe (with the top up), a convertible (top down) and in between (sunroof that is really big!).;Sunroof, easy to use convertible transition, speed.;volkswagen_eos
10/26/2007;crysqo;"So I really wanted a new car and after looking forever, and at numerous cars, I bought the Eos. My car is beautiful! It constantly grabs attention. I got black on black. It's the luxury I want, the utility needed, and fits the budget. And it seals it in a ""young"" looking package. I'm only 23 and when looking at the Volvos, or the Lexus and BMWs and Cadillacs, they all had about everything but are just old feeling to me. It's very true that the car will grow on you. I was unsure of my purchase at first, but after looking through more cars, I fell in love. This truly is an amazing car. And VW is right - it does get into you. The car seems to have its own personality. Very youthful and fun.";Overall look interior and exterior. Everything is crisp, lean, and well put together. The luxury of supposed higher class cars. The hard top! Ambient lighting. The handling is very nice. All around just a super fun ride. Almost everything about it is my favorite!;volkswagen_eos
10/20/2007;oscarkat01;This car drives great and is a joy. It is great driving with top down or up. This car feels much more luxurious the the price. I have never been more disappointed with a car though. The top has been broken for a month now. I have lost top down time which is seasonal where I live. I probably won't be able to put the top down again until spring now. If I wanted a coupe with a sunroof, I would have bought one. I bought a convertible. It is completely unacceptable to me. It doesn't matter how great the car drives or how comfortable it is if I can't put the top down in good weather. I will not be keeping this car. There are plenty of convertibles that don't have these number of problems.;The driving pleasure is great. The handling/ride balance is amazing. It feels much more expensive then it is. The seats are very comfortable. The trunk is useful. The backseat is usable for adults. The controls are perfect. The engine and transmission are spot on.;volkswagen_eos
10/19/2007;Ted;I love my Eos. I've had it since last April and it hasn't been back to the shop since. The interior is roomy and stylish yet simple. I'm very impressed with the gas mileage, getting 28 miles to the gallon on average so far, despite living in the city. The steering is tight and you can really feel the road. It's fun to drive, even if only down the block. The top is simple to use and when it's up it's hard to believe it's a convertible. The only bad thing is the top-down trunk space, but it's big enough to fit small luggage or a couple suitcases. But I've found the back seat makes a good place to put stuff, too. And you don't look like Mr. Moneybags, having a flashy exterior.;Definitely the retracting hard top, which is usable with a push of a button, but amazing to watch. Also, the interior fit and finish looked a lot more like a Mercedes than a VW. ;volkswagen_eos
10/14/2007;Brent;I've owned my Eos for about 2 months now. I have NEVER enjoyed driving a car as much as this one. I'm disappointed everywhere I go that the trip didn't take longer. I think about driving it all day. Yes, it has a couple of weirdnesses, a faint thumping sound sometimes when shifting, and the shifting isn't smooth when it's cold. But litterally other than this, it's the perfect car. It is honestly therapeutic to drive, and I find myself thinking up reasons to go places just to have more time behind the wheel. The top is totally sweet. When it's closed, you can see the sky. When it's open you can feel the sky and the moonroof is great for quick little breaks in the rain. Thanks VW;"1) Super fast 2) huge sunroof 3) comfortable seats 4) awesome lit dashboard at night 5) the ""tiny"" trunk fits a ton of stuff - trips to Costco are easy!";volkswagen_eos
09/28/2007;John;"Great acceleration, but must use a light foot, very easy to ""burn rubber"". I cannot understand why anyone would need the V6. Auto is solid"; the interior controls are easy to use. It takes a while to get used to the narrow seats (I also have a Toyota Avalon), but they break in and are quite comfortable. I considered a Volvo C70, but could not justify the price when compared to the Eos. ;volkswagen_eos
09/25/2007;Kaitar;"I have had this car for almost a month now and I just love it to pieces! Definitely a head-turner, and I get asked all the time about the car! I live in a place where we get a lot of wind storms and that was my concern with the hard top convertible, but it's absolutely no problem - unlike what's said about other hard top convertibles that have no idea what a huge wind sail they put up. This is my first convertible, and although this is my first new car, I feel comfortable saying that this is the car that will be my ""forever ride""!!";Everything! Top up, top down, sunroof, automatic wipers, fun fun fun!!!;volkswagen_eos
09/14/2007;ech;Have owned the Eos for a couple of months. It is ridiculously fun to drive and it gets better over time as you get used to the car's personality. Rear visibility is much better than most convertibles with the top up. The power seats are very comfortable, but I found the tilt of the manually operated seats was fixed in a way that was somewhat painful. The back seat and trunk are actually usable, so while the Eos doesn't scream practicality, it doesn't scream mid-life crisis either. It surprises me more people don't know about this car, but I suppose that's a good thing if you enjoy driving something unique.;"Powerful and efficient engine, DSG transmission, quality paint and interior materials, very effective windblocker. Most of all, owning a car that does something that makes people say ""wow"".";volkswagen_eos
08/24/2007;my car;"This is my third convertible. I live in California and I must have a convertible. I have always been a ""muscle"" car girl so I was thinking of my third mustang when I saw the Eos. My college boys were test driving a VW Rabbit on a rainy day and I stayed behind in the showroom. I noticed this cute car with a line down the back of the top. I asked if it was a hard top convertible and the salesman said ""yes"" and showed it to me. By the time the boys got back I made them a deal. They could have my 2001 GT convertible, 5 speed V8 because I had found my car. The turbo is plenty zippy, the fit and finish are great and the gas mileage was the deal maker.";"I love putting the top down. My kids call it my ""transformer"" like the movie. It is fun to drive and I don't get blown all over like I did in the mustang. The wind screen in the back works like a champ.";volkswagen_eos
08/24/2007;Lisa;I was truly surprised at the power of this 4-cylinder turbo. My husband told me I had become the proud owner of his Lexus after he took it out for the day. I didn't think I would ever be able to go back to a 4 cylinder again, and was surprised that I didn't have to compromise anything in driving power. I was looking for something that would be fun to drive, get good gas mileage, and was hoping for a convertible as well. This matched all my criteria. I fall in love with it more and more each day. ;Hard top convertible, acceleration, mileage, fun to drive. Prepare to feel young again!;volkswagen_eos
08/22/2007;EosToni;"I have never driven a car that has sparked more conversations or more compliments! Anytime I put the top up or down in public I hear ""Aww cool"" and ""Wow!"" and ""Where can I get one of those!"" It's been amazing. Everyone from every walk of life can't help but smile when they see it drive by. My kids love it as well. It's so great that all 3 can sit comfortably and still enjoy a convertible. The back seats are the most spacious of any I've test driven and believe me that's a lot of cars.";I can't say enough about the interior and fabulous seats either. The seats are completely adjustable. If you're on the more petite side, just lift the seat up... yes, it actually raises to the level you need. Not to mention the thousands of ways you can adjust the tilt, lumbar support, etc.;volkswagen_eos
08/20/2007;Kristin;I bought my Eos this June and it's been in for service three times, twice for leaks. They still have it and have had it for 22 days straight claiming the part is being made in Germany. It?s the summertime and I can't even enjoy my top down. This is the first VW I have ever bought and will most likely be the last. The service department has no idea when my part will come in, I find this ridiculous! I also have a problem with the back drive side window, sometimes when you're closing it, it goes back down. This car has caused me so much problems. ;volkswagen_eos;volkswagen_eos
08/17/2007;bjahil47;I have had my Eos for 3 months now and I love it. It is so much fun to drive and I have people staring at me all the time. Only problem I have had is the strap which holds the seat belt is already worn out. I have not told the dealer yet.;The hard top convertible, driving with the top down!! ;volkswagen_eos
08/03/2007;Superdogsteve;"This is the most fun car I have ever driven! I did not even know VW made this vehicle until a friend bought one, and after the test drive, it even convinced my wife we should get a third car for fun and gas savings. I get looks and questions all the time when I drive it, with the top up or down. I even had a guy follow me home to see what it was that I was driving (that was a little strange). All I can say is FUN. It is fast and handles well. It is well appointed and I definitely suggest getting the dynaudio stereo upgrade, it only adds to the fun! It is perfect for my wife and me, with two car seats in the back. Now my two year old always wants to ride in the ""wee car""!";The top of course and the automatic wipers. Style - don't buy this car unless you want attention.;volkswagen_eos
07/21/2007;Ray;My wife wanted a convertible. We researched all the models out there and, having owned a couple BMWs, I figured the new 3 with the folding hardtop was a winner. She drove the Mercedes SLK350 and CLK 350, and the VW beat both out in terms of utility and features. The back seat is really functional for grown-ups and purses and packages. The trunk is large with the top up and decent with the top down. It takes up little garage space. And, not even close to broken in, we got 32 mpg on the last tank! (Break it in gently and you will be rewarded!) Excellent quality. Unique. Sweet! A great all-around car that happens to be a convertible!;Build quality. We wanted the nauga seats with the wheel upgrade. Love 'em. Test drove the Sport package and didn't notice a difference in ride. Couldn't get the nauga seats without avoiding the sport/prem package. Base radio is awesome. Truly a sweet little car my wife has fallen in love with. ;volkswagen_eos
07/12/2007;Bill - Boston;We have had our Eos for seven months with virtually no issues. Has plenty of power, with the 6 speed transmission it is incredible. No issues with water leaks. The top is a mechanical marvel and having the sun roof too makes it a car for all seasons;Shiftable automatic transmission. Handling.;volkswagen_eos
07/06/2007;Yama;"I craved this vehicle for about 7 months, then finally bought one, 3.2, technology and sport package. I could not be more pleased! It is a sure crowd pleaser, and the styling looks ""European"". There is nothing I would change, nothing lacking for me with this vehicle. I've had 6-footers in the back for short trips, and they didn't squawk. But then again, I didn't purchase it to carry folks in the back (I have a van for that!), I bought it to have a vehicle with style, good safety features, and a hardtop convertible.";Of course, the convertible hardtop!;volkswagen_eos
06/29/2007;David;I have never been a car guy. That is over! I have never enjoyed or looked forward to driving like I do now. The feel of the car in my hands is like nothing I have ever experienced. Power is always there and the car absolutely hugs the road. The convertible operation is like a ballet and I never tire of watching it. Nor does anyone else, I stop traffic each time.;The roof, the turbo.;volkswagen_eos
06/26/2007;JAY;I have owned the Eos for a month, and it has made my 5 hr a day drive to work in comfort as well as smooth driving through the LA traffic. I enjoy the choices of a sunroof or top down. The engine is smooth driving as well as noise free. It is an attention getter that makes me feel like I am driving a Mercedes, Audi or a BMW. Wherever I go, it just fits in. This is my 3rd VW from a Cabriolet VW to a New Beetle. This Eos is what a great VW is all about. I am in the fashion field, and I basically feel like a rock star! It's worth the money for me.;Choice of sunroof ortop down is my favorite as well as the comfort of the interior leather. And the VW handle to open the trunk is another fun add on. The seat in the back looks small, but it is comfortable for my passenger.;volkswagen_eos
06/19/2007;Sandi;I looked at a lot of convertibles to replace my 2001 Eclipse Spyder but once I test drove the Eos I was hooked. It is a fun little car that has more get up and go than you would think. The top is also great fun and attracts a lot of attention when going up or down. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a mid priced convertible.;The top, of course.;volkswagen_eos
06/01/2007;suzy;It is so fun to drive and the turbo is much more zippy than the 6 cylinder model that I test drove. My only apprehension was the small trunk space (coming from a Murano) when the top was down. I have managed to stuff 10 shopping bags into the trunk and what I can't get into the trunk I just put in the car. It's a little gem and my little secret. It's rather unassuming from the outside, especially when the top is up, but I know all of its secrets! It's a beautiful car and much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. ;The convertible top, of course! It's quite luxurious and fast. The Dynaudio sound system is very loud and clean especially when the top is down.;volkswagen_eos
05/18/2007;Yama;I've had my Eos for a week, and it compares as good as the Porsche or Lexus vehicles for quality that I've owned previously. The ride is fantastic, and the amenities are superb. The hardtop convertible feature leaves me feeling safer than when I owned a ragtop Celica. I am totally in love with this vehicle! I'm glad I bought the 3.2 with the technology and sport package!;Are you kidding? The hardtop convertible!;volkswagen_eos
05/17/2007;AZEosLover;I drove this car as one of several I intended to consider when replacing a Honda Accord. One test drive and I was hooked. Couldn't wait to get my wife back in to see her reaction. she wasn't excited when I mentioned VW but she did give it a test. One test drive hooked her too. I can't explain to people how much fun this car is! The turbo power is great! Read up on the DSG transmission (Direct Shift Gearbox) and it truly feels like it shifts in 8 ms. Unbelievable! Oh, and the top! What a blast! It's designed so well it's like a work of art (OK, I'm sounding geeky now). 80 mph on the highway and hardly any major wind. I love it! Just drive one and see for yourself. ;The top, the turbo, the transmission, all the features and the way the interior looks at night (like a cockpit);volkswagen_eos
05/13/2007;Sood;We waited several months for this car after ordering it because we couldn't find one with a 3.2L candy white, beige leather, DynAudio, technology package with nav and iPod adapter. It was well worth the wait. The car is unlike any other I have ever driven, even though its really the wife's car. :) I have owned a 3 series and G35 coupe and the Eos is on par or exceeds factors on those cars. People pay a lot of attention to it since there aren't many around.;Nav, Xenon headlights, iPod integration, the roof of course, the sunroof is huge, driving it as a coupe feels solid, the interior is classy, the DSG transmission in manual mode is something else, I could go on forever!;volkswagen_eos
05/12/2007;Oasis;Driving the VW Eos 2.0T DSG 6 sp is a lot of fun. The first thing I liked was the sun roof day or night I could look out at the stars or the clouds and trees. I was surprised that my Eos got 32 mpg and the passing power was so brisk I never experienced that type of passing power before. I also enjoy the fact I can listen to MP3s and the compass is a plus. Electric seats especially the height adjustment made me happy. The roof, what can I say I live in Florida and have the roof down most of the time just turn on the air conditioner for comfort. Last of all some advice. The Eos needs to have a home, a garage, be washed every other week and always use premium gas.;The design!;volkswagen_eos
05/06/2007;Rich;I've had my Eos for 6 months now. It's amazing. Like a convertible without the hassle. I'm not sure why everyone does not have this car. I have had no problems, and love the car. It's so much fun to drive. The top is perfect, no leaks, and always turns heads when you open and close it. The 6 speed manual trans is great. Much better than the 5 speed I had in my Jetta. The only minus I can think of is that you can't hear the whine of turbo anymore like in the 1.8T. VW needs to fix this. The whine was so cool. Also, with the top down there is too much body flex. They need to stiffen the frame a little.;The top.;volkswagen_eos
05/03/2007;atlguy34;I had a 2005 Passat that I swore I would never sell. Then I drove an EOS one day while I was having my Passat serviced. I was hooked. Within 3 days I had one in my driveway. The car is a blast to drive, not to mention it's really cool. And since they are still relatively new, it attracts a lot of attention. The way the trunk is configured, you can not see where the car ends. Mine came with Park Distance Control which at first I thought was lame, but after driving the car for a while, it's a necessity. ;The top, of course. It's a hard top, has a working sunroof, or can be a convertible. What more could you ask for? And with the top up, it's quieter than my Passat was. It has plenty of power for zipping around town and still gets decent gas mileage.;volkswagen_eos
04/13/2007;Mike Moore;I have had my Eos since the end of December and have enjoyed every minute with the car. It is an attractive vehicle that garners many looks and questions from people. It is enjoyable and comfortable during my 35 mile daily round trip on a misture of highway and surface streets. It's jack of all trades character in regard to coupe, convertible or open sunroof auto, it's performance and it's comfort reassure me each and every day that I made a good decision in investing into the VW Eos. I'm a happy, sun tanned disciple of the Goddess Eos! :-);The flexibility of coupe and convertible, the interior comfortability, ergonomics, details and options I selected. The sporty yet comfortable driving characteristics presented with the DSG transmission. ;volkswagen_eos
04/09/2007;Fatboy;"We just purchased our new Eos and I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised at the room inside such a small and sporty car. I'm 6'-04"" and 340 lbs and usually just have to walk right past the ""sports cars"". Not this one - I fit in it with room to spare, yet my petite wife also can adjust it to meet her requirements. The car is sporty, peppy, and very nice. It is not without its drawbacks, but they are minor and it is a blast to drive. Fit and finish are superb and the 3-in-1 top is ""tops""! Lots of neat features and it's still a very ""green machine"" with over 30 mpg it you baby it. All in all, top marks for this new V-dub! Gotta hand it to those Germans - sporty with room!";Front seat room, sporty and peppy even with automatic transmission, tiptronic auto trans is super! Love that German engineering.;volkswagen_eos
04/08/2007;samron;My husband hated my Z4 - too small and uncomfortable. He wanted a luxury car; I wanted sporty and convertible. Our 3.2 EOS fits the bill perfectly. We test drove a 2.0 one day;volkswagen_eos
04/03/2007;austin_eos;This is a car for a person who wants a bit of everything in a car: sporty performance, practicality with 4-seat capacity, acceptable trunk space, comfort, interior and exterior style, and of course, a convertible. If you feel the urge to splurge on any particular feature, then you might want to get dedicated sports car or comfort sedan. But if you want a bit of everything, the Eos works well. I've had my Eos for about 4 months in various weather, and it has held up great and has been fun to drive. So far no reliability problems. ;Nice comfortable interior styling, having a sunroof really does enhance a convertible.;volkswagen_eos
03/28/2007;solarflare;You don?t have to give up a sunroof or front wheel drive with this baby! I get 35-42 mpg highway and with 200 horses under the hood! The DSG transmission is smooth and responsive and I love the fact that the car sounds much like a manual when accelerating. My EOS has the luxury package with rear park assist, two options that I highly recommend. The interior trim, mine has the cornsilk beige, is top notch and very elegant. The car is beautiful inside and out! Handling with the top down is a bit awkward but the car is a blast to drive. The leather seats are a bit hard but not uncomfortable. The EOS has style and class and I think VW has a winner here! ;Sunroof! DSG Transmission. 2.0T Engine power and fuel economy. Interior styling.;volkswagen_eos
03/27/2007;bnw514;I just got my eos 3 days ago and have been driving top down the whole time. I like when I stop at the store people stare because they've never seen it before. Then I put the top up, just to give them a show and make them gawk. Then I zip off with the sound of the turbo. Although, 1/2 a mile down the road I have to pull over and let the top back down, just because it's a nice spring day. Plus all the guys dig it because it has the turbo. Hope that doesn't get me in trouble because it has more power than any other VW iIhave owned. Trust me, so far, the best car I have ever bought. And this makes #6. It reminds me of a less boxy Mercedes SLK.;The top, of course is the coolest. Also the direct ipod plug-in in the console. Crazy things, the seat has a button up top to move it back and forwards, automatically. Cooled glove box. Sports shifter. Can program it to tell you mpg, or how many miles til empty. Also has optional alarm for speeding;volkswagen_eos
03/20/2007;blowinthwind;I love driving this car. I would rate the fun to drive factor higher than a 10 if I could. It handles well and after driving a big van for the last 8 years I appreciate how easy it is to get where I want to be. The car responds well. It is a blast to own. Every day someone comments on it. My son's friends think it is the coolest car ever - I do too.;The top - what else? ;volkswagen_eos
03/17/2007;antonio;"I just bought a VW Eos 2.0T with an automatic transmission and it has far exceeded my expectations. It is a great car. It has a surprisingly comfortable interior that is very quiet, even with the top down. It has plenty of leg room in the front seats (I am 6'3"" and I have plenty of room in the front) and the back seats are ""tolerable"" for short trips. It is also very agile and quick. The upgraded audio system is superb! The best feature of this car is the fact that when the top is up it has all the characteristics of a coupe (without the downfalls of typical convertible) and with the touch of a button (and waiting 25 seconds) the car ""transforms"" into a beautiful convertible.";The sound system, sunroof/convertible, acceleration, braking and great looks!;volkswagen_eos
02/26/2007;Pepino;This vehicle is everything it's comparable rivals are plus more. The hard top is obviously the biggie, however the additional sunroof (huge) is the extra. Closed, the outside noise is low and you'd never know it is a convertible. The bells and whistles are abundant and you get a great bang for your buck. The base is more than what the other can even touch for the price. Yes it can be expensive, but it is a great built vehicle and a blast to drive. ;The manual transmission is great and adds to the driving experience though it is hard to find at dealers. The convertible top is great and the sunroof is large. It has tons of pep and decent gas mileage.;volkswagen_eos
02/22/2007;Sue in FL;I'm coming up on the 5,000 mile service and I have no complaints about this car. I still am excited every time I put the top down or open the sunroof. One minor issue is that the sunroof is significantly louder than my Jetta's, but the roof opening is also much larger.;The roof, of course.;volkswagen_eos
02/20/2007;Prashanth;This is the first coupe-convertible with a hardtop. Getting this car is definitely my best choice ever. I had to wait some time before I could get a deal on the price, but what do you expect from a best-selling car in Europe? The car as a coupe is exceptionally quiet inside, compared to the conventional canvas-top convertibles. The interior is very classy and the dashboard colors are pleasing to the eye, and not at all a distraction. While driving it as a convertible, the ride is very smooth and with very minimal jerks. The wheels hug the road beautifully while turning and making quick curves, and I was in fact prodded by the test-drive guy to turn it at 60 mph to see that it had no effect on the car's handling.;The interior space, interior dashboard colors, convertible operation, and exceptional handling.. It is very quiet as a coupe and its pickup is great.;volkswagen_eos
02/06/2007;Mickey;"I was pleasantly surprised by the interior roominess for such a small car. I'm 5' 10"" and like to stretch out my legs, but there's still leg room behind my driver's seat for a passenger for short distances. The hardtop roof is awesome and makes this convertible much more solid and stable than a rag top. This car is spunky, but has very good fuel economy. It has got all the toys of a pricier car. I am very pleased with it so far even though I have had it only one week. It's not my recently sold 911 Carerra Cabriolet, but it doesn't have the price tag or the maintenance costs either and it's a lot more practicable. I hope it holds up.";The convertible hardtop with retractable panoramic moonroof. This car is quiet and smooth with lots of spunk, yet good fuel economy.;volkswagen_eos
02/05/2007;Chris;Hands down the Eos is one of the top 5 best new model cars of 2007. The mid trim level combines the best of VW and Audi design in the 2.0 liter turbo FSI engine and the 6 speed DSG automatic. The 200 horses push this car from 0-60 in 7 seconds regardless of the transmission (a feat that will turn many manual drivers into DSG fans). The 5 piece stacking hard top designed by Webesto features a panoramic sunroof that is only one of it's kind. Dynaudio spent 2 years working with VW to tune a 10 speaker sound system to the interior dynamics. The Pontiac G6 doesn't come close in features or reliability and the Volvo equivalent is $10,000 more. It even gets 31 mpg hwy for summer top down crusin'.;"The 2.0L Turbo FSI engine, DSG automatic transmission, Dynaudio stereo, iPod integration, Webesto 5 piece roof, panoramic sunroof, Climatronic ""smart"" AC/Heat, ESP stabilization, sport mode, wind blocker, seat warmers, 12 way adj. seats, and parking distance control.";volkswagen_eos
02/05/2007;RTC;This car has a very poky 2.0T engine. It likes to sneak over the speed limit. Like on most vehicles, opt for comfort over the sport package and you get a surprisingly together ride, borderline cushy and quieter. My car is averaging 24.8 mpg - and not from cautious driving. So far I have driven it in freezing conditions and have no complaints. I feel as snug as a bug inside with the roof up. It is tight with some small cowl shake on harsh bumps, but so was my former 330Ci. This car is very practical. The Dynaudio MP3 player is amazing. It is definitely a B plus and maybe more for simple unpretentious top up and top down fun.;The defrosting side mirrors, cockpit comfort and looks, and the roof of course.;volkswagen_eos
01/24/2007;spaceinvader;"The 2.0L turbo engine is powerful, but thirsty on fuel. The sports suspension is great on smooth roads, but the car ""rattles"" and the chassis flexes on other roads that are not flat.. I had a dead battery after two weeks, and the dealer could find no reason as to what caused it. The climate control system failed after three weeks. There was a one week delay in waiting for parts. This car has lots of internal condensation, i.e. window dripping with water. I found the spare wheel well full of water, due to faulty welded joint in the body panels behind the left hand side rear light cluster. My Eos has been off of the road for eight days while the dealer finds / fixes the water problem. VW customer service not interested in my problems. ";Diving with the roof down on a sunny day.;volkswagen_eos
01/13/2007;R.Graves;I absolutely love my 2007 VW Eos. I ordered and patiently waited for it. I got it in December 2006 and I have not put the top up yet. And I live in NJ. If you use the windshield with the top down, you get the luxury of having the convertible style and fun with the warmth of a sedan. This is truly a phenomenal car. I love my VW.;The automatic climate control is wonderful. It knows when you have the top down and it compensates for the change in cabin temperature. Also, my iPod can play through the stereo and displays on the navigation screen. No more iPod tuner! ;volkswagen_eos
01/07/2007;RB;After a few months of researching convertibles and not finding a hard top reasonably priced, there was an article on the EOS in our local paper. After going online to Edmunds and VW website for more information, I went to the dealership and bought it that day. Going from a mid-size SUV to small convertible, I thought it would take some adjustment. However, it is so much fun to drive and feels like a solid car around me. It has excellent pick up, especially getting on the freeway. The hardtop easily retracts and amazes me with the technology. I love driving with the top down, even it is chilly out, I just turn the heated seat up. I'm thrilled with my purchase. ;the automatic hardtop, heated seats, acceleration and handling, and color (blue).;volkswagen_eos
01/07/2007;jpn;I drove my Thunder Blue/Biege leather 2.0T out of showroom 12/31 and have already driven 1,000 miles. I use any excuse to drive a little more. Warm weather in NY has made it possible to drive with top down and it is awesome. With luxury package, I find more features than I had with my Audi A6. This car is beautiful, has a quality interior, and it has comfortable seats for a big guy. My teenage daughters actually think their dad is cool.;The retractable hardtop, sunroof, turbo transmission, good gas mileage, comfortable seats, and premium sound system.;volkswagen_eos
01/02/2007;Prashanth;I drove a Honda before this and though I loved it, I was always dreaming of a convertible, and VW came out with a winner. I've had this car for three months now and haven't found anything bad about it. The handling is exceptional, while making turns and on bumpy roads. And it runs very much like a sports car. With the top down it's a complete adventure, and with the top up, it's dead quiet inside, as a regular coupe. This car is an out and out winner. Even though the price might seem a little upscale but I'd prefer this over a Mustang any day, which hardly holds its value after a couple of years. The Eos has given me complete satisfaction and a bang for the buck.;the folding mechanism and how it has plenty of rear room.;volkswagen_eos
12/30/2006;Old&amp;Crazy;My Eos is optioned with the sports package, 18 inch wheels/Pirelli P-6's and 6 speed auto. It is great fun to drive. The cabin is quiet with the top up or down. It feels a bit quicker than the stated 0-60 times. It has a nice punch above 40 mph. It also has a nice balance between handling and ride. The handling dynamics are good enough to make the car fun, but not equal to BMW as some other reviewers have written. The engine/transmission set-up very responsive. The leather sports seats are well bolstered and very comfortable. I am taller and larger than average guy and the interior is very comfortable. I also looked at Volvo C70 and the VW is more fun and about $8,000 less expensive when optioned out. The Eos is a great car, great value, and loads of fun to drive.;volkswagen_eos
12/27/2006;Janice Marie;This is my second VW. At first I was hesitant to buy the Eos since I love and miss the look of the Cabrio (my first VW), but it was time for a new car so I bought it. I love it! Even though I can't put the top down yet (purchased in Dec.) it is still so fun to drive with the top up, especially since it also has a sunroof! The car is beautiful all around and runs like a dream. The only thing I would change is to not have to continuously hold the button down to open the top. A one-touch opening would have been nice. But let me tell you, when it opens, it looks-as my 5 year old niece describes- like the Bat mobile! It is a great car and I would recommend it to those who really love convertibles.;The sunroof and automatic top (of course). The hard-top look (nice in the winter and very quiet inside as opposed to the soft-top Cabrio).;volkswagen_eos
12/19/2006;EOS1;This car is excellent. It is peppy and fun to drive. It is comfortable when pushed.;The sport seats have excellent holding power and almost infinite adjustability.;volkswagen_eos
12/18/2006;Phil;I just picked up my new black on black Eos two days ago, so these are just my initial impressions. I consider the exterior to be stately and not flashy. The versatility of the roof is unique and fun! The interior is impeccable and well thought out, although it could use a few more cubbyholes for sunglasses, phones, etc. The interior storage becomes limited, when you opt for the navigation system, which moves the 6 CD player from the dash to the center console between the front seats. The Eos is very quick and responsive once the turbo kicks in. There is a slight hesitation from a dead stop, but once the turbo kicks in, you're in for a great driving experience. ;The fact that it is a coupe when the top is up, the sunroof and full convertible top versatility, the navigation system is easy to use with a very clear map, the comfortable seats, how the rear wind blocker also serves to cover the rear seats allowing you to hide articles placed on the back seat, if you run out of trunk space. The standard radio is excellent.;volkswagen_eos
12/11/2006;red;I just purchased my Eos this weekend after thinking about it for several months. What a waste of time! I absolutely love this car. The Eos is well designed and rides like a sports car. Its suspension is better than the one of my previous BMW 330CI with the M-suspension. The Eos' 6-speed automatic transmission is outstanding and the shifters on the steering wheel are great...speeding tickets here I come. This car has is no rattling and no quality issues whatsoever. Open or close the top and you will be the talk of the town. It even has a sunroof in the convertible top - thats just the icing on the cake! Volkswagen really did some benchmarking and incorporated the best of its competitors' features. Did I mention I love the car? ;The near top, transmission, suspension, ride, engine, interior, seats, style, navigation system, auto lights, instruments, sunroof, owner's manual DVD, and good head lights.;volkswagen_eos
12/05/2006;Steve;I got my Eos yesterday. It is the first 3.2 I could find in South Florida. I paid about $42,000 for it (MSRP) with bells/whistles. The top motion is as cool as reported. It's fun to drive; very responsive and has lots of umph. I did not test the 2.0 so can't compare to that. I got the Eismeer Blue which is much nicer looking than on my computer. I was gonna get the thunder or paprika but now love the Eismeer. It has a great stereo with Sirius on the premium audio option. Also, it has a sport pkg. and navigation pkg. This car is really an eye-catcher. The only other comparable car that's a hard top convertible 4 seater (this really can seat 4 adults not terribly uncomfortably) is a Volvo (and looks like a Volvo). I was pleased to grab this car as I had been looking for weeks and this was first that I have found.;volkswagen_eos
11/30/2006;EosTRS;If you want a fun, cheap and hot car, then the Eos is for you. I urge you to go out to you VW dealership and at least test drive one. This car is excellent. Buy one, if your wife will let you.;The interior design and exterior are amazing. Also, the automatic gear changing is super fast.;volkswagen_eos
11/29/2006;seakay;I just took a trip to Virginia from Miami and the back seat was a little small for an adult. When driving on the interstate with the top down, and the screen up, you really don't get much wind, and you can still hear the sound from the stereo, which is not the norm.;How fast the top goes down and the sound system is great!;volkswagen_eos
11/25/2006;Nancy;I am so happy with my Eos. It is fun to drive, beautiful, and has lots of power for a small car. Having the hardtop fold into the trunk is a wonderful feature. I get comments daily on the beautiful blue color. I really am happy with my car, and so is my husband!;The heated seats, turbo, how the roof folds into the trunk, how it holds four passengers comfortably, the stunning blue color, and great gas mileage.;volkswagen_eos
11/14/2006;Cindy;I traded in my 2001 Cabrio for this car and oh boy am I in love! This car handles like a dream. It is the most responsive car I have ever driven and I've driven some great cars. If you want to drive a great car, with great gas mileage and still have a ball doing it this is the car for you! ;Of course the retractable roof! I also love the heated seats, the stereo, the sunroof, and the dashboard display. OK, I can't pick a favorite! I love them all.;volkswagen_eos
11/09/2006;larsd619;I purchased my Eos about two months ago. I love it. The hard top is great. It actually gets better gas mileage than posted on the sticker. The transmission is smooth as well as quick. The sport transmission makes a noticeable difference. This is the best hard top on the market for the price. ;The hard top convertible, sport transmission, and super heated seats.;volkswagen_eos
11/07/2006;Rocket Pilot;This car is much, much better than I expected. It is very fun to drive. I love the turbo boost! It accelerates from 80 mph faster than from 20-40 mph. Driving at high speeds feels like 40 or 50 mph. This car is an autobahn burner. The handling is sublime. I love the balance, it sure does not feel like a front wheel car until the front tires do a burn out when the turbo kicks in at 40 mph! Wow! The transmission is fantastic: it shifts, it's not a slush box. It is reasonably quiet. The Luxury Package gives it a beautiful and classy interior. It is much better than any BMW 3-Series I've ever driven (I have not driven the latest M3), and more fun. It has better handling than the Audi A4. And nothing can compare to the top!;The handling, turbo boost, good gas mileage, the undeniable and pervasive feeling of quality and tasteful design, the auto transmission, and that top! The seats, climate control system, and the lighting are great, too.;volkswagen_eos
10/29/2006;Rich;This car has all the qualities that I always wanted in a convertible: performance, power, good gas mileage, safety, and it's fun to drive. The list goes on and on. It's like having the features of an Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz with a VW price. ;The DSG transmission, hardtop convertible, and sunroof feature.;volkswagen_eos
10/24/2006;cindy;Overall, this car is satisfactory. I had an '06 Toyota Solara and traded it in for this car since it had a hard top. The sunroof, when open, is deafening even with the wind shield. Also, my car has an air leak in the window on the driver's side, but Volkswagen won't address it since it is a convertible.;The great pickup and easy to use top.;volkswagen_eos
10/21/2006;HoustonMob;I did enough research to purchase this car two days ago. I've read lots of reviews on other convertibles like Audi TT, Audi A4, Volvo C70, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky, Mercedes SLKs, Pontiac G6, Ford Mustangs, Mazda Miata, etc, which are all between, $25,000 and $40K,000. After serious considerations, I finally narrowed down my options to the Sky, Miata, and Eos. I couldn't get over the Miata's small car look and sorry, for Saturn, I have heard bad news about that brand. I traded in my Nissan 350Z coupe to Carmax, and was able to get out of my 8-month remaining lease with only couple hundred dollars upside down. Many dealerships tried to rip people off in big city but finally found one honest one. I am thrilled to own this Black / Beige / Sport Package. I love it;The retractable hard top with moonroof. Get the package option, you can't go wrong with all the automatic/luxury features like auto wiper, tire pressure monitor, and etc. The Eos gets nice mileage for a fast car. I used to only get less than 20 mpg. This is one car I can be thrilled with the mileage on.;volkswagen_eos
10/17/2006;w;I just purchased and drove an Eos off the lot. I did my homework on this car (I spent hours reviewing forums and feedback from others - I even went to German website forums and translated them into english to learn more about the vehicle). I also read extensively about the 2.0T engine and DSG transmission from other cars including the Audi A3, A4 and VW R32, Jetta, Passat. Bottom line: this car has a lot of value for the money. More importantly, it performs well for a sports coupe regardless of cost and has the ability to be upgraded aftermarket for not much more money to be a true sports car. Finally, it's a convertible - the best way to travel down the road! ;The DSG transmission, auto hard top, leatherette seats, radio with 6 numbers displayed, and wide sunroof.;volkswagen_eos
10/15/2006;Jake;I looked for a year before purchasing the EOS. It's truly the best buy out there for less than $35,000. I don't recommend paying for the Luxury or Sport packages, as you can get the upgraded radio and wheels for about $2,000 less. For a family who may need to seat four, and prefers a solid hard-top and front wheel drive, but enjoys the top down every so often, there is nothing out there like the EOS.;There are lots of nice suprises, like 1-touch operation for all four windows, sliding armrest, cool LED tailights that look clear but glow red, easy entry to the back seats, and the awesome interior with nothing that looks cheap at all. The seats are very comfortable and the sunroof is huge. this car has great visibility.;volkswagen_eos
10/14/2006;Tom G;I just bought my Eos five days ago and I am having a great time with it. It is a lot of fun to drive with the stick. The retratable roof is a great conversation starter. It handles great with plenty of power.;The radio upgrade sounds awesome. This car handles very well. And of course the roof is sweet.;volkswagen_eos
10/13/2006;Love it too death;I've had my EOS for a month. I got rid of an '06 Civic because it stunk. My EOS actually gets BETTER mileage than the Civic. It's tons of fun to drive. It feels like you're stuck to the road. I have owned VW's before and forgot how much fun it is to drive since I got rid of the last one (500,000 miles). This car is without a doubt the best car in it's class. It is very comfortable and just a pleasure to drive. I recently got 35 MPG on a 200 mile trip where my average speed was 70 MPH. My suggestion, buy one if you can!;The retractable top, quick acceleration, and seat heaters.;volkswagen_eos
10/12/2006;Marshall;"I love my new EOS, but the dealer charged list for it. AND, be warned, VW will not let you order Navigation ($1,800) without also ordering Turbo ($2,000) and the Luxury or Sport Package ($3,490 / $3,690). Therefore, Navigation actually costs a minimum of $7,290! And if, for example, you don't want to be part of the animal trade, and prefer the ""leatherette"" upholstery to leather, you can't have Nav at all. Get lost! (iterally..).";volkswagen_eos;volkswagen_eos
10/08/2006;esells;I have had the car for a week now and still love it, I have to drive to kids to every event and my SUV's are gathering dust along with my motorcycle. After hearing the horror stories about the A4 quattro and BMW electronics I decided to give this car a try. Driving SUVs for over 10 years, I forgot what it is like to have a car throw you against the seat and the Eos does it in spades! I am going to look at the fall colors today since the Broncos play tomorrow.;Getting on the freeway and punching it! It is very cozy inside. I am looking forward to a top down Colorado winter. I love the crowd that gathers when the top goes up or down.;volkswagen_eos
10/06/2006;Sonia Simms-Sanchez;I just purchased this car and I will tell you it is a nice car, I like the fact that it has the 3 in one vehicle. The performance is good, it has a smooth ride. I would recommend you purchase this car.;This car is loaded except for the navigation system. I like how the dislay dash lights up. It is a great car;volkswagen_eos
09/21/2009;Eric;I really appreciate the maneuverability of this car. (It's great for parking.) It's fun on curves and stable on the highway. I haven't had any bad experiences with wind gusts, etc. It's not a sports car, and I'm fine with that. The reliability and economic fuel consumption are what I was after. I couldn't be happier.;On the two-door hatchback the doors are large, which makes for easy ingress and egress. The center-mounted display is not big deal and makes room for another glove box. You sit higher that in most two-doors, so your visibility is better.;toyota_yaris
09/21/2009;Gaki;I've had my '07 Yaris for just over 3 years now and I must say it has to be one of the best cars I've owned!! Not only does it get around 27 mpg around town, but the maintenance costs are very small. The only maintenance I put in were oil changes, new set of tires at 40k, new air filter, and new front window blades in order to pass last inspection. So far, the car hasn't given me any problems and is truly fun to drive. It has enough pick-up and handles well in all weather conditions. I highly recommend this vehicle if you are on a budget like I am. I feel that the Toyota Yaris is perfect given what I paid for it!;I fell in love with the MP3 aux input and the positioning of the cup holders. That by itself is the tipping point of what sells a car!!;toyota_yaris
09/19/2009;hot in arizona;Brought it used in June. My grandkids were with me and we named it Baby Blue. It's a great little car. Went on a 1300 mile trip to California. Baby blue performed great. Went up mountains with no trouble; A/C was great. Seats are very comfortable. It drives like a bigger car. Lots of room for luggage. The radio was best of all the small cars I have owned. ;toyota_yaris
09/17/2009;mrack;I average 32mpg in city per tank, 40mpg pure highway driving. Ample storage. Enough power to get you moving. Throttle response varies from 0.2 sec (noticeable, but on par with other DBW cars) to well OVER a second on warm days (omg what is wrong w/ my car). Variable means you can't adapt to it because it changes. This causes premature clutch wear because rev-matching for downshifts cannot be done reliably. Toyota will not warranty clutch repair no matter how few miles. Mine is still holding on, but it has developed a shudder at 20k miles... it's just a matter of time. No tach available on the manual hatchback. I'm on my 3rd factory MP3 stereo.;Turning radius is the best I've ever experienced, ample storage, gas mileage, price. ;toyota_yaris
09/07/2009;&#034;S&#034;Above all other niceties the mpg- factor is tops by far. After six round trips from Florida to NJ and one 4,500- mile trip to NE, the average highway mph is much better than advertised: 44 mph on mostly interstate driving, using regular (10% ethane) 85 octane gasoline, air conditioning on constantly. Local efficiency is steady at 33/34 mpg. Long distance driving is comfortable, surprisingly large baggage room. However, the center mounted instrument panel is irritating now as is was the first day I drove this otherwise wonderful little car!;toyota_yaris
08/25/2009;Page;This is a great little car. We get 39mpg with this one. Very roomy interior, more so than the Corolla we traded in. No problems encountered, has enough power accessories too and the ipod plug to keep the teenagers happy with the car. Can't find anything wrong, priced right for quality!;Great storage space, cup holders, ipod/MP player connection was the only one we could find in 2007, Toyota is ahead of the game.;toyota_yaris
08/20/2009;Alley123;I love this car! Had it for over 2 years with no troubles. Routine oil changes are only required every 5000 miles instead of the usual 3000. My tires will need replacing soon (currently have 37000 miles on them.) I love that it's a small car, yet the seats feel more like that of a van in that you sit straight up instead of the laid back/stretched out position of many cars. And I haven't found anything that doesn't fit in the back when the seat is folded down. The back seat is very roomy for a two-door car. You don't hit your head on the ceiling and enough leg room for an average person. Great gas mileage, although I've never gotten what other people have reported (I get 33-36 mpg).;Comfortable seat positions, great mpg, awesome storage capacity, great buying price, I can park anywhere! 7 cup holders and 3 glove compartments.;toyota_yaris
08/07/2009;Broken hearted;I rear-ended another vehicle that left a dent on their bumper and did $3500 damage to my Yaris! Why so fragile? And the airbag didn't even go off. I love the car. I put the back seat down and use the hatchback/space like it's a pickup truck for building and garden supplies, etc. It's amazing what you can get in that little car. My manual transmission and reasonable driving practices result in >40 mpg IN TOWN! I love this car, I just wish it weren't so fragile.;Seven (7) cupholders! Yay! Roomy back seat. Great handling. Cute and gets lots of questions/comments from others.;toyota_yaris
07/29/2009;zelaya_ed;I'm in college... and the last thing I wanted to have to worry about was my car. So I decided to go with a toyota - having to be on a budget the Yaris was definitely in my price range. Immediately I fell in love with the car, it looked cool, had an ipod jack built in, power everything, and finally I got to the gas station. 20 bucks filled her up, what a buy. ;Ipod Jack, interior design;toyota_yaris
07/28/2009;Ben-David Kaminski;With the proper driving you can get over 40mpg. The car is great in snow. It is a great car to customize and turn heads for little money. Toyota quality should last a long time.;Mpg, looks, hatchback.;toyota_yaris
12/08/2007;dan;Since i purchased my 2007 Yaris in August i immediately fell in love with the gas mileage, average of 35 city and as much as 48 hwy. But i found that on option was unavaible for a keyless remote which i really miss. The 12v outlet in the console needs to be redesigned because the cover will not stay closed. I also found that you cannot roll the windows down in the rear without getting a head splitting noise. When you are used to riding with the rear windows down when it is not hot enough for the air conditioner this is a disappointment. I am a large guy and the interior room is great, seats are good and good leg room.;The seats are great as well as the leg and head room. Fuel mileage is great averaging 35 to 48. I got the one with abs brakes and have had no problems stopping. The 1.5 engine is great for my needs with plenty of pep. ;toyota_yaris
11/28/2007;barkpr;"I've had the car about a year now and the love affair continues. Got the 2 door hatchback. I still cannot believe that Toyota could put this style, comfort and reliability together at this price range. Every day it's vroom when I start the engine, I actually feel like I am driving a much bigger car or even an suv when I am behind the wheel, great visibility and have been averaging about 38 miles per gallon. It is peppy as hell and my wife says it is cute. Highly recommend to all who want great dependability, great gas mileage and ""cute"" style at a great price.";The pep and styling.;toyota_yaris
11/25/2007;Kirk Ryerson;I researched about 15 cars in this segment. The only thing that motivated me to purchase the Yaris was the promise of no scheduled maintenance for the first 120,000 miles. That was the deciding factor. EPA ratings are off, I average low 30s in town and mid 30s on the highway. The brakes are terrible. It struggles to take turns. The electric steering (at highway speeds) is frightening. My S didn't even come with a remote key fob. Be careful driving the S on a windy day.;"The driver's seat (for me) was the best feature - I'm 6'1"" and couldn't find a better seat for me in this class range. Next to that I am (personally) amazed this is a 1.5 liter engine - it does just fine staying with traffic which I really appreciate.";toyota_yaris
11/09/2007;Howard&#039;s Yaris;Awesome ride for a small car. Comfort is quite nice. It did take some time to get used to the controls being in the center of console. The mileage is second to none... 30s in the city and near 40 mpg on the highway. For the price, it is an awesome buy.;toyota_yaris
11/06/2007;TommyG;This car is priced reasonably, so you can't put too high of expectations on it. Its engine power is adequate, though not impressive. Road noise is quite high. So is the engine noise. It seems to be well-built, though we had a plastic engine compartment cover fall off of the bottom of the vehicle a few months after we got it. The snow level was fairly high, and since the car sits low, the snow probably pulled it off. I'd consider it a design flaw. The Toyota technician said it was a common problem, but refused to replace it under warranty. The MPG isn't what it was originally rated. We have managed to get 40 mpg, but usually get about 30 (some highway, some city) ;Ipod plug. Good MPG. ;toyota_yaris
10/30/2007;noway;Overall it's nice that it gets great gas mileage and is a smooth drive. However, the body is not safe in an accident. At 3 mph I hit a truck and my car was very badly messed up (from hitting something at 3 MPH!!). I don't think this is a very safe car.;Gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
10/29/2007;charlielisha;I love the car! Very fun to drive. We used to drive a Chevy Aveo, since I test drove a Yaris I traded in the Aveo right away. The Yaris is more stable, quiet, more hp and very fun to drive. The best is its fuel efficiency (40MPG).;Very affordable, fuel efficiency and made in Japan!;toyota_yaris

The gas savings have been awesome with milage averaging 39-41 MPG with a mix of stop and go and highway driving. It is comfortable, handles great and is pure joy!!;Sound system is great. Love the center speedometer!;toyota_yaris
10/28/2007;Kumar;I was in the market for about 3 months to buy a second car. Researched almost everything! Finally decided on Yaris and now feels great about my decision. Inside space is too good for a subcompact car. Handling is super.;Excellent gas mileage, simple controls, easy to handle.;toyota_yaris
10/10/2007;kevin sheldrick;Excellent small car for back and forth to work and on trips . Great on gas. I get a lot of ribbing from co-workers but laugh all the way past the gas stations.;CD player.;toyota_yaris
09/30/2007;Sean;I did a lot of research on this car before buying, and love it! It is fun to drive around, cheap on gas, and with Toyota's name, I'm sure it will be very reliable. I get compliments on it everywhere I go.;The looks of it, and I really like how all of the gauges are in the center of the dash.;toyota_yaris
09/30/2007;Toni;Initially, I looked at the '05-'07 Toyota Corollas, but once I test drove the Yaris, I was impressed by the sporty and comfortable driving experience. In my search for this car, I read posts from other owners, and now I am happy to add my very favorable opinion on this car. The purchase of this car is one of my best spending decisions, and likely to be yours once you decide on the model (sport/standard), color and transmission (auto/manual). Overall, it was the multiple tests drives of this car that convinced me to buy a new Yaris instead of the used Corolla.;I absolutely love the driver's side glove box right above the steering wheel. No more stretching over to the passenger's side for a pen/paper, lipstick, lotion, etc. It's all right there within reach. The other thing I really like is the 60/40 split rear seat. This comes in the power pkg.;toyota_yaris
09/27/2007;Jess;Had mine for 6 months, and it's a great car. Easy to drive, and sits high enough in the interior so I don't feel like I'm driving a small car. I've taken it on one long distance trip, and it was very comfortable for 4 people. I'm averaging about 33 MPG commuting in the city. Lots of fun to drive, and parking is a breeze. People constantly stop to check it out, and I've been surprised at the amount of cargo it can hold with the fold-down seats. I traded in my Camry for the Yaris, and don't regret it for a second. It's simply a fun little car!;Several people hate the cup holders, but I love them. The placement in front of the air vents actually keeps my drink cool! Might be a problem for coffee, though. The gas mileage and seat height are great, absorbs road bumps with ease. Lots of storage for such a small car.;toyota_yaris
09/20/2007;Joan;We love our Yaris! It consistently gets between 37-42 mpg. It is comfortable on long trips and has plenty of zip going up and down hills and for passing. Both of us are tall and have plenty of space inside with the automatic transmission. Back-seat passengers are surprised with the comfort and leg room. With the hatchback, we're able to carry large items with no difficulty. Our Yaris is our favorite all-time car!;Design of car, storage and drink areas, space when back seat is down, exceptional gas mileage, instrument location.;toyota_yaris
09/19/2007;Lyle;This is a great vehicle for people who want to have a solid commuter which does not cost them money. I do drive a lot on the highway and I also do drive the speed limits and accelerate at a modest rate, but any driver can achieve great fuel mileage on this car. After 5000 miles, I'm averaging over 44 MPG. I use the air conditioner whenever it's warm. The Yaris is made for economical driving and is not meant to substitute for a sporty car. For the price, you get a little more than you pay for if legendary Toyota reliability is present and I'll know that in a couple hundred thousand miles. I highly recommend this car for responsible people who keep a budget and are environmentally aware.;Fuel efficiency is my favorite feature, but exterior design is a close second. The seats are more comfortable for long trips than any BMW, Honda or Toyota truck I've owned.;toyota_yaris
09/14/2007;MD;This car has excellent handling, performance, and gas mileage. I drive 40 miles to work one way. I had to find a car that was great on fuel and comfortable to sit in for 45 minutes.;The dash design is very unique with the all the gauges in the center, this allows for a better view of the road.;toyota_yaris
09/13/2007;Brittany;I love this car. I got a brand new car with great gas mileage! It's a cute car. A lot of space. Tough little cookie. The gauges are easy to get used to. Don't be fooled. Awesome buy!;So much room! Easy to drive.;toyota_yaris
09/06/2007;KbJay;A cute, basic car. I got it for the gas mileage, as I was looking for something comparable to my old Echo (poor thing was totalled last month). It's relatively inexpensive in comparison to its counterparts on the market. The interior design needs improvement here and there, but it drives smoothly.;The MP3 jack. The turning radius. The The 41-42 MPG/hwy I've been getting is phenomenal in and of itself. ;toyota_yaris
09/04/2007;Kevin Sheldrick;I purchased my Yaris hatchback in April 07. Have put 7500 miles on it already. Have had four people in it comfortably. Love it. My wife cannot wait for the Toyota Ractis, a very similar car to the Yaris, to be offered in the U.S.;Cupholders and compartments.;toyota_yaris
09/03/2007;Allison;I love love love my Yaris, it is my first brand new car, and the smartest decision I've made in a while. It's super fun to drive, super cheap to fill up at the pump. I love that people will stop and check it out when I'm out. ;Cup holders, the dash, the mileage, warms up quickly in the winters, cools down fast in the summer.;toyota_yaris
09/03/2007;dennis thompson;My Toyota Yaris has served me well. I use my Toyota Yaris to go to my mountain cabin and my desert cabin. One is seven thousand feet and the other is three thousand feet. This car allows me to be able to travel to both of these places economically. I get 40 plus miles per gallon on the high way and 30 plus in town. It also has plenty of power to get me up the hills.;My favorite features of this car is that it has an absolutely great sound system. There is plenty of room in the car, we don't always have to squish in and there is plenty of foot room as well.;toyota_yaris
09/02/2007;Aaron T;I have S 4 door manual, blue. Added sun roof and leather seats - nice look! It gets me consistently 34-35 mpg. I do a lot of stop/go (driving in San Francisco) and also highway driving. The car looks awesome with the blue color, like a sports car. You can get nice torque with the stickshift but it's a very delicate stick and not easy to shift smoothly. I like the driving style, easy to handle, factory tires and breaks are good. The body quality is my main problem with it. I had a 2001 V6 Maxima before which had much higher quality interior and exterior, body was tough. Besides the cheap body, it's also very light. A big car accident would obliterate it, I think. ;The MPG is consistent at 34-35, even if I drive it a bit rougher with the stick. Blue color makes it look like sports car, awesome. MP3 plug-in. Zippy. Good trunk space. Spacious back seats in 4DR (2DR is too tight for someone over 5'6, imo). I think price is decent for what you get.;toyota_yaris
08/28/2007;TBM;The placement of the a/c condenser, close to the ground, and very little protection from the grille can cause foreign objects to damage the condenser, especially small rocks. A very small rock penetrated through the grill and damaged the condenser causing a micro hole depressurizing the a/c system. The a/c no longer works. I took it to a Toyota dealer even though it is under warranty I still had to pay $80.00 for them to look at it because the damage was caused by an outside object and was not covered. The bill to repair it was $1200.00. Toyota should have put wire mesh in that area of the grille to protect the condenser. Positives are gas mileage and price, but you get what you pay for;Gas mileage, driver's leg room.;toyota_yaris
08/24/2007;RogerW;I have been a Toyota customer since 1983 and most recently owned a 2000 Camry until it was totaled in an accident. I wanted another Toyota and was looking for better gas mileage than my 25 mpg Camry. I have 3,000 miles on it now and havn't gotten better than 28 mpg. I am so disappointed that I am thinking of getting rid of it and buying another Camry. My driving habits haven't changed and it only gets 3 mpg better than my bigger 2000 Camry. Not happy!!;The cupholders are located in a bad area. Unless you have 32 ounce foam cups they fall out of cupholders.;toyota_yaris
08/21/2007;zippyaris;The Yaris has the looks and then some. For 106 hp, this car has pick up. I have gone 100 mph on it, and it feels very stable (except when there's a lot of wind the car feels like it's floating and not on the ground). Do not be scared to drive it on the highways. I have gone on multiple road trips with it and it is so much fun, especially driving through windy roads. I could not imagine driving any other car on highway 1 (of course except a Ferrari). ;Tight turns, great handling - super nimble - great for lane changes, passing and merging, awesome sound system with iPod hookup, and let's not forget... 40 MPG!! My last full tank cost me less than 30 bucks - now how many people can say that?;toyota_yaris
08/21/2007;Mark S.;Was traveling cross country when my 1984 Cressida broke down. Wanted a base Corolla but the dealer was out of them. Test drove the Yaris and thought it would suffice. My first fill up and I was amazed at the 42 mpg. I have been getting 42 mpg consistently rain or shine. At 4500 miles it isn't even broken in, so I expect 44 mpg or so once it is broken in. It is peppy, handles well and looks awesome from the front. Great slope on wind shield.;Economy and the Toyota name.;toyota_yaris
08/16/2007;Jewls;I have just gotten my Yaris and I love it. It looks so stylish and is so comfortable, with all the great handling that all my Toyotas have had. My first car was a Tercel and I recently had a Tacoma. But this is way better than the Tercel. I have quickly adapted to the center console. It just makes sense.;The handling, the price and the style.;toyota_yaris
08/13/2007;cgh;I like small cars and a hatchback is my favorite body style. Having done some online research and discovering that this vehicle had the same drive train as the Scion xA and xB and the same engine as the Prius, I was intrigued. I hunted one down online that was totally devoid of the overpriced options. Having previously owned a Geo Metro I was a bit apprehensive about the acceleration and hill climbing ability of an ultra high mileage car. I took it for a test drive and was I ever surprised! It accelerated and handled like a small sports car, while at the same time having an interior that was roomy with comfortable seats. It was a frugal sports car lovers dream. I bought it the next day.;This car has a very stiff undercarriage for a small car and also has amazingly precise electric power steering. The acceleration is very good if you know how to safely wind out a 5 speed. I'm getting about 35mpg around town with the ac on and almost 40 mpg on the open road with no ac on.;toyota_yaris
07/26/2007;Manuela Inman;I went to Germany to visit some relatives and they had a Yaris. I fell in love with it over there. When it came out over here I just had to have one. I love that it is roomy, and easy to handle. You can get in just about any parking space. It is very fuel efficient and good looking. People even stop and look.;Fuel economy, color and design.;toyota_yaris
07/16/2007;Mike;"First, let's be clear. I'm a satisficer, not a maximizer. All cars are compromises, and this is expecially true at the lower end of the price spectrum. I'm 6'2"" and, ahem, let's just say over 300 pounds at the present time. I can get in and out of this car with no problem. It runs like a charm, turns on a dime, the steering and braking are silky smooth and I've still got a quarter of a tank left with the odometer at 325+ miles, so I'm heading for 40+ mpg on the first tank. Yes, the seats could be better, maybe Toyota will fix them, maybe not. The cup holders are neat - you can send the air around them - or use the AC to cool your drink. Nothing's perfect, but the Yaris is awfully good.";Nice big doors, easy entrance/exit for tall people + excellent visibility when driving. Wonderful almost magical turning radius makes parking in crowded parking lots almost fun. Lots of places to stash assorted stuff. Handles speed humps with aplomb.;toyota_yaris
07/08/2007;dericy;"This was what I was looking for. Good looks, good mileage, Toyota is its name. The 1989 Civic hatchback almost made it to 300k and you will certainly hear about it if this doesn't. I got a great basic car. No radio, 14"" wheels, roll up windows, exactly like I am used to. I threw in an aftermarket Pioneer 6900ub with direct usb link to the iPod and I have a great commuter, even for those times when I have to sit in Seattle area traffic. ";toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
07/08/2007;Andy K.;The Yaris Liftback is the first car I've owned (5th total) that I truly LOVE. It looks small, compact, and stylin' from the outside, yet it's literally HUGE on the inside. None of my passengers can believe how much room there is until they've sat in it. The steering is silky smooth and responsive, the engine is surprisingly good for something quite small, and the interior design is amazing. Toyota did an amazing job with this design. It's main use for me is city life/city driving (5 people fit no problem), but we've also taken it on road trips and it's been very nice (for 2 people) as the back seat folds down for a ton of added trunk space. I've been getting almost 40 mpg on the highway. A+ !;Thoughtful interior layout makes it easy to keep things tidy. Oodles of small compartments (3 glove boxes!). Smooth steering and turn radius. MP3 player aux jack (with perfect size partition for my cased-in iPod to sit in right next to it). SEVEN cup holders. Top notch air-conditioner that cools FAST.;toyota_yaris
07/07/2007;Scott;"I bought my Yaris Liftback after selling a new 2007 VW Rabbit which was not a good fit for me. The Yaris is everything the Rabbit is not: fun, light, thrifty, nimble, and solidly built. I'm 50, and I grew up driving basic cars so the simple nature of the Yaris really appeals to me. Great visibility, light and intuitive controls, roomy (I'm 6'5"" & 175 lbs), practical, and very frugal with fuel. So far, I'm a very happy new owner.";Very easy to service (oil/filter changes, and basic maintence is a snap), very good interior ergonomics and sight lines, cool interior and exterior design, Toyota quality.;toyota_yaris
06/28/2007;goldieee;I drive the 3 door hatchback and it's the cutest little car ever, cuter than the Volkswagen buggy, Minicooper, etc. People always comment about how adorable my car is. I'm always happy at the pump because it only costs me about 30-35 dollars to fill up the tank, and it lasts about 1.5-2 weeks. It's roomy, comfortable, and reliable! :);Fuel economy, exterior design, MP3 jack.;toyota_yaris
06/26/2007;mxzebrax;This is a wonderful car for the price. At about 13,000 you can't expect much. The Yaris is like a a good $5 hamburger, it's good, but it's not a filet mignon. For the price, I feel this is the best car out there. I did a lot of shopping before buying and am very pleased with it. For a while I was a little iffy, but then I got the windows tinted and it looks way better, especially since I got a dark blue color. Dark cars need dark windows. This was my first car. ;Great mileage. I average about 30 mpg zipping around town which is only 4 under the EPA. I haven't had much time to test it on the highway. Looks, I like that it looks like a Camry. Speedometer. You definitely get used to it, and miss it when you drive a different car. It's a Toyota. ;toyota_yaris
06/26/2007;Jennifer;I have had my Yaris for a week now! I got into a car accident so was forced to get rid of my Saturn Ion. I love the Yaris. The mileage is much better, it runs smooth. I have broken 100 in this car and it never felt faster than 50. The turning radius is wonderful. I opted for the leather interior. I drive over 100 miles a day to and from work so this car is wonderful with gas prices soaring. The only thing I dislike is the cup holders but I do like the extra ones in the doors. Way to go Toyota! ;Gas mileage, trunk space, turning radius.;toyota_yaris
06/17/2007;Wendy;I love this car. It is very affordable and great on gas. I have two kids who have plenty of room in the back seat. The stereo system is excellent and it's wired to plug your MP3 player right in. Also like having lots of cup holders and bottle holders (6 total). Had to get used to speedometer in the middle of the dashboard, but it's great for back seat drivers. :) The body style is adorable and easy to fit into small spaces. The only thing I don't like about this car is that the acceleration is not as quick as I'm used to, but it's not TOO bad. I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy another Yaris. ;Plug in jack for MP3 player, bottle holders in doors, fold down rear seat for extra cargo in trunk, nice stereo system.;toyota_yaris
06/17/2007;lucy;We purchased a Yaris and Scion 5 months ago. Loved the cars. My Scion got totalled by someone not paying attention 3 weeks ago - the car did great at keeping me safe, just bruising where the seat belt and air bag got me. I went right out and purchased a Yaris like my husband's as the Scion wasn't available in the color I wanted. The Yaris is fantastic. Gets great gas mileage, easy to see out of to reverse, great acceleration. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to listen. Thanks Toyota! ;Acceleration, storage compartments, large trunk, shape of car.;toyota_yaris
06/16/2007;DolphinRyan39;The Toyota Yaris S Sedan is a stylish, reliable, and fuel economic vehicle. For all it has to offer, along with it's highly reasonable price, I recommend it to anyone.;The body kit on the S Sedan is very nice, helping to bring out the contours of the vehicle.;toyota_yaris

06/08/2007;Yaris Fan;Have had Yaris for 1900 miles or 2 1/2 weeks. Trip to Maine and 103 miles per day work. Its ride is very good for its size. Handles on highway much better than I thought, hugs the road and can change lane in a flash when needed. Gas mileage is way better than EPA states. I have averaged 42 plus miles per gallon since first day. 42 the lowest going to Maine averaged 78 MPH A/C on and I got 42.18 MPG. Best so far 43.50 MPG. That is combination city and highway. I don't race or see if I can beat everyone to the stop sign or light. I get there 1/2 second later and about $3.00 cheaper. If you want a car that is great on MPG then Yaris can not be beat for the money.;MPG. Brakes and looks. Looks like the car from the cartoon CARS. Always has a smile. Total cost to run this car. WOW. Better than hybrids.;toyota_yaris
06/06/2007;micweb;This is the type of car I expected from VW - compact, highly efficient, well made, and innovative. Well, I had to go to Toyota to get it, but at least there are a ton of Toyota dealers to get it serviced at! :-) I gave up some creature comforts that I hardly miss - like power windows etc. - but got a great price. This puppy accelerates FAST with a 5 speed. It is more sporty than my old VW Golf! At the same time I am getting 35-37 mpg during this break-in period on my freeway commute. Quiet when cruising. Engine noise when accelerating, but that's the trade off for a sub-2500 pound car that does well in NHTSA, NCAP, and IIHS crash tests. I'm a happy new owner!;Unique styling. Smooth engine with great acceleration (5 speed). Toyota build quality. Great gas mileage. Exceptionally spacious for one, roomy enough for 2. Kids only in back, please!;toyota_yaris
06/05/2007;Laurie;"I bought this car a little over a month ago, and have really enjoyed it. It's my first new car, so I've been really careful during the ""break in"" process. I can tell it has gotten smoother during this time. The steering is awesome! I also have come to really like the center console design. It's easy to use and find all the controls. Sometimes I wish there were a tachometer, but it's not a big deal. This is a great car for anyone who just wants a buzz-around car! It does great on the highway as well, although it has a harder time accelerating on hills (and with more than 2 adults in the car). But I still love it for what it is!!";Size, steering, body style/looks, gas mileage, practicality.;toyota_yaris
06/04/2007;matt_n;I really do love my Yaris. I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews from various editors, but in the end I decided to trust the consumer reviews, and I'm glad I did. As long as you understand that you are not going to have the fastest car in the world, I think you will be pleased if you purchase a Yaris. I have a light touch on the pedal to conserve my MPG, but it has no problem traveling in the fast lane. I have never driven a hatchback, but now I am hooked forever! Some reviews talk about a lack of a fun factor, but trust me, it's a lot more fun than handling a big truck or SUV. It's a great feeling to fill up my tank and know it's going to last me the week! That alone is worth it.;The auxiliary jack. I have to be able to listen to my music library on my MP3 player wherever I go! It's a smooth ride. The look of the car is nice, and the color (Meteorite Metallic) is MUCH nicer than it appears on the Toyota website.;toyota_yaris
06/04/2007;jonesmiddle;I drive mostly in the city, and I usually get around 36 mpg with the automatic transmission. The handling is adequate for the car, but it could be a bit better. The interior is nicley finished, but it would be better if the speedometer, etc., were in front of the driver by the steering wheel instead of to the side. The seats are pretty comfortable and there is plenty of room in the rear seats and in the trunk. It took me a while to find the ABS that I wanted though. Adding a turbocharged engine could help up performance while pushing fuel consumption even lower and improving performance.;Great gas mileage, low price even with the most expensive packages, great looking exterior;toyota_yaris
06/01/2007;Shep;I love this car. It barely uses gas and saves me so much money. It looks and feels great on the highway. Very little noise. ;Gas mileage, quick, inexpensive.;toyota_yaris
05/30/2007;Chris;The car is a real pleasure to drive. I drive 60+ miles a day and this car has performed well above my expectations. It accelerates well and has no problems at freeway speeds. A very solid car all around.;Fuel economy, storage, roominess, peppy power train, doors close solid with no rattle.;toyota_yaris
05/30/2007;I M AWESOME;I wanted the Rabbit as I have always had a GTI and couldn't afford the new ones. I mosey into the Toyota dealership and see the Yaris and wasn't convinced at first until I drove it. It's a little slow off the gun, but once you get into the mid-range, she has some go. It's the most fun car I've driven and it's more comfortable than the Mini. I got the convenience package which is good, but plan on getting all the TRD accessories. Gas mileage is great, which was my primary motivation for the car, but I never expected it to be so fun to drive. Got the Blazing Blue and plan on making it look like the commercial. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend it to anyone.;More room than I could ever dream of with so many storage compartments that are hide-away. There is so much room in the car you can easily fit 4 adults with no cramping or stuffing.;toyota_yaris
05/28/2007;Kevin;We love our Yaris, we are absolutely 100% pleased, Usually with big purchases we have some buyer's remorse, but we are totally at peace with this purchase. It looks great, gets great mileage, fits all four of us comfortably with plenty of room in the trunk for luggage. ;I like the looks, the price that we bought it for, the gas mileage, and the sound system is also pretty good. I also like how much room we have inside.;toyota_yaris
05/26/2007;trisarahtops22;About 2 weeks ago I got my new red Yaris! I know I havent had it that long, but so far I love it. It handles really well, it's fun to drive and it looks great! I love the design. ;I went from a '90 cavalier to this car, so pretty much everything is my favorite! I enjoy how all the gauges are in the center, not behind the steering wheel. It's very unique! I also really like the storage compartment between the 2 front seats, it's very handy. ;toyota_yaris
05/24/2007;KP;I have had my Yaris for about 2 weeks know. I love the middle gauges because now I don't have to look through the steering wheel to see them. I got 34 mpg for first two tanks. The steering wheel is a little cheesy looking. I got every option offered and so far so good. Don't like that there is no place to put change or your cell phone or that the cup holders when you put a cup in them block the A/C vent. That won't work when it is 95 degrees outside. The outside of the car I love. As for acceleration, I have a manual so it has done pretty good. I drive on a major highway to work and it keeps up with all the other cars at 80 mph. Plus it's a Toyota so it is going to last.;Exterior look, middle gauges, gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
05/22/2007;OKJoe;After just over 1000 miles, we took a trip to OK City on Friday. We got 330 miles out of exactly 9 gallons of gas for a total of 36.7 miles per gallon, all highway on cruise control, going about 74 MPH. Everything is great so far. I have the same complaints as my first review. I have to agree that the seats are not as comfortable as I'd like on long trips. They might break in though after a while. A minor complaint is that the turn signal auto shut off could be more sensitive. I seem to have to shut it off manually on slow wide turns. Otherwise we both love the car!;Mileage and looks.;toyota_yaris
05/19/2007;Eurostar;I got this car in Oct 06,, ever since just loving it, I'm upgrading a lot of parts to this car, the car was built to be a tuner, lots of aftermarket parts for it. It's very easy and fun to drive, great performance and MPG for its class, and the best of all is that it looks very nice, stylish, European and sporty.;Great looking car with Euro style, extremely fun to drive, great performance in its class with a five speed manual gear box.;toyota_yaris

05/13/2007;MC;I expected the great gas mileage (I'm getting 35 pretty routinely and 38-40 on long trips), but the advertising doesn't tell you how much fun it is to drive! You sit up high - feels a little like an SUV in this regard - so road visibility is great. This thing turns on a dime, so you can zip in and out of really tight spots. Mine is a standard (5 sp) transmission, so pickup (even with the AC running) is a non-issue. Good passenger room (I have the 4-door.) Safety issue: there is a HUGE blind spot between the rt. rear passenger window and the back window - you really MUST use the passenger-side mirror to see what's coming up behind you on the rt. side.;Driver's seat sits you up higher than in many bigger cars. Interior room and trunk room are both unexpectedly generous for such a small car. Steering is steady and straight. Turning radius unbelievable.;toyota_yaris
05/10/2007;YarisOwner;I have had this car two weeks and have not put gas in it yet! I really enjoy this car and think it is worth the money. I have enjoyed my little go-kart so far and look forward to driving it for a long time.;Everything, I really enjoy this little car.;toyota_yaris
05/10/2007;karrat;I had an Accord for a while, but rising gas prices ($3.50 at the time) pushed me towards a more economical car. I settled on the Yaris for the fuel efficiency and cost; I get around 37 mpg on average, mostly highway driving (35 mile commute each way to work). It is a very basic vehicle, but it suits my needs just fine. I opted for the MP3/CD player which was well worth it. The AUX jack in the center console is very useful, but the placement (right below the shifter) is a little awkward. The car looks quite small on the inside, but my friends comment on how much room there is on the inside (more than they expected, at least).;toyota_yaris
05/10/2007;Belmont;It's comfortable and fun to drive. I love the mileage I get.;Drink holders and little storage compartments here and there;toyota_yaris
05/09/2007;StGabriel;I had a Toyota Yaris hatchback and I loved it. I don't think there is a better value on the market. I am 6'5 and the car was very comfortable and could handle 3 passengers just fine (the car is way roomier than it looks). Gas mileage is fantastic (consistently 34+ mpg) and the cost-to-own is the lowest you're going to get. It won't set any speed records but I found that the car could easily get up to good freeway speeds and was fun to drive. I love the distinctive look. I got a lot of appreciative looks and positive comments. Also, I was impressed by how well the car absorbed the impact of a high speed collision. ;The huge value that this car offers. Also, safety. I speak of the car in the past tense because our lovely Yaris was totalled by a drunk driver. We were rear-ended by a huge truck on the freeway. The Yaris was totalled but my wife and I managed to get out of it with surprisingly few injuries.;toyota_yaris
05/05/2007;radu;This is a nice looking car, it looks somehow like a sports car. But don?t get misled. The Yaris driving is less inspired than many others. Driving position is simply wrong: the steering is too far for taller drivers compared with any other car on the market, therefore driving pleasure and feeling are much reduced. Good front visibility but dangerous blind spots on the sides. Excellent build quality, however the paint chips easily. Very poor clutch conception, hard to engage smoothly or quickly, automatic transmission it?s a must for this car. Gas mileage is less than expected, especially in city driving.;Interior space, build quality and reliability, how it looks.;toyota_yaris
05/03/2007;Jeff;Timing couldn't be more perfect. In the small cars category, Toyota brought a Europe-proven model to the US market and beats the rest in the category for value and reliability with fuel efficiency, kick in the drive and my 4-door sedan Yaris is the biggest small car at this price! Even driving at my high speed average of 82 mph on highway commute, fuel efficiency is still at good 37 mpg.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
05/01/2007;jjrigadoon;My husband & I are in our 60s and it took a day to get used to the center dash and now we much prefer it. No lights glaring in your face at night, handy glovebox at all times. We had a Volkswagon GTI which my husband loved for its power and handling. If this had the power, it would be as much fun, however, it has plenty of power for the size and gas usage. No trouble getting up to speed to merge on interstates, which was a concern.;Center dash;toyota_yaris
04/29/2007;deb;Have had my Yaris for 9 months and so far all is well! It's great on gas mileage, averaging 30+ and that's with lots of short trips in town. Cute styling, comfy interior even for my 6 foot 200 pound son, and decent room for back seat passengers. Trunk is huge, too. I'm 51 years old and previously drove a 1991 Toyota pickup which was EXTREMELY reliable. Had to stop driving it due to arthritis (had to give up the manual transmission, dang it!). If this little Yaris cutie is half as good as my Toy truck I'll be a happy camper!;Gas mileage, roominess for small car.;toyota_yaris
04/22/2007;kenc9;Great car, this is the Bug that VW should have built. Low price and high mileage. The gauge area was a concern at first BUT a few days later and this layout is fantastic. All the compartments in the dash, the MP3 jack the huge inside of a small appearing car. I should be hating driving a cheap car like this, I bought it for my daughter that is going to college soon. I am 52 and it is a solid car that gives me the feeling that this little car will tick away forever. Everyone stares at it or smiles when I pass them. Nobody did that even in my BMW X5. Everyone I have sit in it and sees the room inside says WOW! ;Compartments in dash, MP3 port, dash layout, front of car like a VW Bug. around 40 MPG, laydown back seats. Drives like it is on tracks, at 75 MPH it feels VERY stable. Turns around anywhere.;toyota_yaris
04/16/2007;OKJoe;We picked up our Yaris under a week ago so this is definitely a first impression, but I'll keep you updated. Although very small there is generous room inside and a surprising amount of rear leg room. Several people sat in the driver's seat and one 6'2 would have a difficult time driving the car. The center mounted speedometer took all of 10 minutes to adjust to. We put 240 miles on a trip this weekend, very little highway, and used half a tank of gas. Based on the tank size it calculates out to 42.2 MPG. Probably 40 mpg is more reasonable. Exterior is black metalflake - very nice paint. I would recommend this car to anyone!;Gas mileage of course. Interior room. Aluminum wheels are nice. Seat upholstery very nice. Paint job was superb. Solid thud when closing doors.;toyota_yaris
04/16/2007;Garry;The only thing I have to tell about the drive is simple. The best thing to do before driving this car is to start the engine, put it on drive, hold the brake and wait for one or even 2 minutes like this. After what you can enjoy a perfectly warm oil for the transmission and a better engine and transmission maintenance over a long period.;The radio that come with the basic features is enough for everyone. It even takes my MP3 CDs. Excellent features including the fact that I like to see the speed I'm going with the speedometer in the middle of the dash.;toyota_yaris
04/13/2007;XoQuixxoQAFXo;Bought my Yaris on March 31st after comparing it to several other cars including the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa. Eventually I went back to the Yaris and easily found a nautical blue sedan with the power package with steel wheels, the keyless entry, side and side curtain airbags, and all weather package. After driving the Yaris for about 2 weeks, I absolutely love it! I love how I get 350 miles on one tank and it only cost $25 bucks to fill it up. :-D;Gas mileage (averaged about 34 mpg and should keep increasing, only have about 600 miles on the car), Cute looks, peppy 1.5L VVT-i engine, dark blue color, easy to park and drive, the blue gauges.;toyota_yaris
04/12/2007;MangoMan;I'm quite happy with the Yaris. Excellent design with lots of room for adult passengers and a huge trunk. I avg 31 mpg in-town commuting. Overall, I 'm very pleased with the car but the interior needs some re-design. Toyota forgot to put somewhere to hold change! No ashtray, no console tray or pocket. Come on, guys. My only other complaint is the car is overly susceptible to crosswind. Maybe some suspension or tire/wheel change could improve that. To me those are the only deficits in an otherwise well planned and executed entry level automobile.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
04/12/2007;ToyotaOwner;Great vehicle! We traded our 2002 Tacoma for the Yaris, and so far we have no complaints (we just had our 10,000 mile service yesterday)! The car is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, and for the engine size and fuel economy has decent power. The car is roomier than it looks, and is a head turner wherever you go. The price is not too high considering it is a Toyota and it will last forever. Anyone in the market for a new car should test drive a Yaris. ;Styling, S-package, 5-speed manual transmission, MP3 capability, side curtain airbags, overall build quality, Toyota reliability.;toyota_yaris
04/11/2007;Brad;"I had an 02 Honda Accord, 4 cyl., and wanted better mileage. I did a lot of research, and didn't find a better price for the mileage. I've only had it 3 days now, but I love the car. Small tweaks to the interior (longer arm rest/center console, and someplace to rest a cell phone) would be great. My only complaint in the rear view mirror. I'm 5'9"", and the mirror is right in my line of vision for intersection traffic. I'm going to have my dealer move it up. Great ride, I have no problem with road noise.";Body style, steering/handling is very responsive. Good acceleration from dead stop and passing.;toyota_yaris
04/04/2007;Mr driver;Performance: The Yaris gives you the feeling that you are in a golf cart and keeping up with normal/slow traffic is tough, with 106 hp, you will not pass anyone who dosent slow down for you! Comfort: Compromised by the fact that seating 5 people will make it all but impossible to get up to the speed limit before the next stop. Ride: Smooth but the driver's seat sits awkward if you're tall because of where the steering wheel is mounted due to the cramped interior. Fuel: I haven't been able to get more than 389 miles out of a full tank which is 34.5 miles a gallon when averaging between city and highway. Good fuel economy but the 1998 Corolla got almost as good about 2 miles less a gallon + 140hp.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
04/02/2007;yoyocheerio;I absolutely love this car. I have owned a toyota before, a 1986 MR2, and was very pleased with it so when it came time to buy my first new car, I was definitely going to look at Toyota. I've got a lot of expenses with my 2 kids and so I needed to keep the cost manageable. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get a decent car for my budget but I am thrilled to have discovered the Yaris. It is perfect for me - great gas mileage, fun to drive, great design inside and out, it's a Toyota and on top of all that its affordable. It's too good to be true. ;The overall style of the car. The aux input for my iPod. The gas mileage. The rear wiper. All the storage places.;toyota_yaris
03/28/2007;drgagnon;Love the car but the seats are a problem. My wife and I never had back pain until we purchased this Yaris. But I like it enough to try to change the seats. This is an expensive proposition with minimal out of market options. I'll probably have to sell the car to save my back. However, driving the Yaris is fun and above expectations considering the price.;Fuel efficiency is remarkable. Forget about the hybrid.;toyota_yaris
03/23/2007;lindsey;I just got my new Olive Mist 4dr Yaris. I just got to 200 miles and have no complaints, it is the cutest thing, people think it's a Volkswagen. Since having this I wouldn't trade it for anything; it has great pickup and turning corners is a blast. I like the cupholders where they are, it's kinda different. Gas is also GREAT, like I said, made it to 200 miles and still have over half a tank left! Get one!;toyota_yaris
03/23/2007;A-town;I have had this car for a little over 6 months and have 10000 miles on her. I get gas mileage between 33-35 in mixed driving, I got up to 41 on a road trip. The car is great. It is nothing fancy but hasn't had any trouble with her so far.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
03/20/2007;Toleckia;My experience in the 2007 Yaris is great. I love my new car. It is a stylish, comfortable, and affordable vehicle. It drives smooth which makes it fun to drive. If anyone ask me how does it feel to drive a Yaris, I will tell them it feels great. I would recommend anyone who wants a car that's afordable and comfortable to buy a Yaris.;My favorite features are everything about the Yaris. Even though this is my first new car, it gets my approval in every way.;toyota_yaris
03/15/2007;cpwray;I am a freeway/open road driver from a more rural area. Seldom (to never) are we in a rush hour crawl. The Yaris posts near hybrid fuel efficiency with out the hybrid's price tag. Power windows, locks and cruise control and fairly good CD sound along with power steering and A/C make this economy model more pleasurable than the economy models of 3 and 4 years ago. I am six-three 230 lbs and enjoy riding in and driving this car. My family has four Toyotas and I do not fit in my daughter's Corolla. The Yaris is a different story: it has better interior room.;"By putting the Yaris in service I've reduced my greenhouse gas emissions by 55% over my previous ride. I am not ""saving the environment"" by any means but I might be destroying it at a significantly slower pace. ";toyota_yaris
03/13/2007;Peter;Great mileage,good fit and finish. Ends there. Clutch and drivability the worst of any small car, wish I took a longer test drive. Those who say fun to drive, best test other small vehicles. Will be trading soon. First and last Toyota experience. This is my 6th small car experience and most disappointing in many ways.;Mileage is great.;toyota_yaris
03/11/2007;Ashley;I have been researching this vehicle since it came out last year and it has completely lived up to the Toyota reputation. The gas mileage is amazing! We took a 700 mile trip and we only filled the tank twice and still had a half of tank left over! I love my new Yaris!;The cup holders and the auxiliary plug for my iPod. The trunk space is huge too for a smaller car.;toyota_yaris
03/08/2007;lonewolf;I love this car. I have driven a Ford F150 my whole life and this is a big change for me. I drove several other cars and didn't like them as much. The Yaris looks best and drives better than its competition.;I am one of the strange ones that actually enjoys the speedometer being in the middle of the dash.;toyota_yaris
03/07/2007;Woodyb;Yes it's small and maybe a little drumming inside, but I expected it. Bottom line: great car. Had to make a 20 hour run for a family thing, three bad disks in my back and all. No back problems and total comfort for the whole drive. I'm sold.;Fun to drive and gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
03/04/2007;TSABOMBDOG;After buying old cars that I can fix my own, (old VW,and fords) until major jobs (transmission, etc.), I have gotten tired and bought this car. The first thing I looked for was fuel consumption. I wanted a hybrid, but at my federal wages it was out of my sight. Then I found 07 yaris 2 dr, 5sp M. It has the feel of my old bug, but more room for storage, great fuel consumtion and great price range.;Full view of road (massive view), gas consumption (incredible 2nd to hybrid), power when I need it (5spd M), sub-compact (parking), great handling.;toyota_yaris
02/21/2007;lphan;I was surprised at the room that this subcompact could had. The gas mileage is great for travelers and college students on a budget that live far from their hometowns. ;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
02/14/2007;RD;I finally got the car with additional antilock brakes and curtain side air bag for added safety. Got 17 inch after market rims with wider tires for additional traction and stability. It looks great and is really fun to drive and very fuel efficient. Toyota's reliability has a proven tract. I currently own a Sequoia, a Camry, and an 07 LS 460. I'm 6 ft 1 and I use this for my daily commute for obvoius practical reasons. I had my fair share of luxury European cars (I won't mention out of ethics) and my ownership experience were not good. ;Fuel efficiency, surprising roominess or front seats.;toyota_yaris
02/09/2007;Keith;The Yaris is a great car and economical in so many ways. If you are looking for a reliable car that is cheap on the gas then go for the Yaris. I preferred the 4 door to the Liftback version but it was still hard to decide which one to buy. I read some reviews out there about how the car lacks some things, but it is what it is. The small engine might put you off, but don't let it. It can really keep pace and does great on the highway. ;Comfortable driver and passenger seats;toyota_yaris
02/03/2007;javi67;"This was only the second new car I've ever bought and I love it. I was one of the first people in LA to drive one and i loved the looks and the comments, most of them made while I was in the car. Great gas mileage. Love my iPod jack. I can fit all sizes of people in it. It's white and it's been nicknamed the ""tic-tac"". Now I see them everywhere - don't you just hate that? ";-);toyota_yaris
01/26/2007;Gas Saver;"For a little car it has just enough low end acceleration and handles tight. I bought it strictly for the mileage it gets expecting a cheap chunk of plastic. However, it was anything but. The outer body design is kind of funky. The interior is surprisingly comfortable as well. I am 6'2"" tall and have plenty of leg room. ";I like the way the instrument cluster is centered in the car and of course the mileage.;toyota_yaris
01/19/2007;vtrans;The car got upper 30s when we first got it. Two weeks into owning mileage dropped to 30 mpg. I was after a go-cart for the street but the manual door locks and sub-par gas mileage are annoying;The car is a breeze to wax, none of the funky moldings to tape off. Interior is nicely laid out, surprising backseat room.;toyota_yaris
01/15/2007;Melissa;I love my car. I was driving an 04 Jeep Wrangler and getting about 15 mpg because of the 6 cyl and AWD. I went to Toyota and test drove the car I was destined to buy. I was out the door with the keys in my hand about 4 hours later. Have had it over a month, and LOVE it. Great fuel economy (about $23.00 to fill up) and a tank lasts about a week. Awesome car to zip all over town in, comfortable and handles well. Roomy enough on the inside considering the size. I would definitely recommend the Yaris to anyone looking for a fuel-efficient, comfortable, and stylish ride!!;Center console, Aux port for my iPod, suprisingly comfortable interior. ;toyota_yaris
01/13/2007;Schandelle;I just got my new Yaris today and I love it. It is taking me some time to get used to driving a new car, but it handles great. It excels much better than my old car, and very quickly for a 4 cylinder. I got the 4 door sedan. I didn't get any special features, just a radio/cd player, but it is better equipped than my old car. At this pricepoint, the payments are affordable on my part time college student income. I just can't say enough about my car.;I love that it has an MP3 jack, and I like the centered odometer.;toyota_yaris

01/09/2007;Jordan;This car gets excellent gas mileage, is fun to drive, sharp looking, and inexpensive even with some options. One very nice option is the MP3 player port, which was my excuse for a new iPod. Most surprising is the spaciousness of this car. For how small it is, it is very roomy, especially in the back. I was very surprised by that. This is my first Toyota, and it won't be my last. I can only say one bad thing about this car, but even it is typical of cars today anyway... it has rattling issues. This is mostly just because of all the plastic used on cars now. It's just something you will have to put up with no matter what kind of car you drive. ;The MP3 player port, and the centered gauges.;toyota_yaris
01/08/2007;Rebecca;Excellent gas mileage, fun to drive, roomy interior (despite what it may look like from outside), great for long trips AND city driving, perfect for parallel parking. The back seats fold down easily to give extra space for groceries, luggage, etc. All in all, I couldn't be happier with this car. Other benefits are the price, and the fact that it is relatively environmentally friendly and will help weaken our dependence on oil :0);toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
01/06/2007;Danielle Marie;I fell in love with my Yaris from the moment I saw it. I felt so excited to be the first one in my city to have a Yaris, and they curious looks I got. I love everything about the car except two things. Be careful when it is very windy because it will blow you around like a leaf in the fall. Second, I still have not gotten the gas mileage I am supposed to be getting. I am only getting 33 mpg on a good fill up. It should be between 34-40.;Center console, quick 0-60, tight turning radius, great sound system, can hook up ipod to speakers.;toyota_yaris
01/06/2007;Cruiser;Saw a Yaris sedan drive by and was impressed with the styling. When I found out it was a Toyota and very reasonably priced I had to test drive. Hard to get but the dealer ordered in a sedan, auto, Flint Mica, and the 'B' package. In Canada that gets you ABS, EBD, A/C, power doors, windows, locks mirrors, and keyless entry, a$2000 CAD or about $1600 US. Great little car that doesn't look or feel little at all. Looks more expensive than my dad's Corolla and better equipped for less money. You do get use to the centre speedometer and tach (standard in Canada) but I hate where the cupholders are and I need a centre armrest that is not behind my arm. Still,overall it's a great car, buy one!;External styling, Flint Mica colour. Charcoal grey interior, fit and finish. Feels bigger and more expensive than it is. No one thinks it's an econobox when they see it and it's a Toyota. Solid ride, competent, no sports feel but around competent.;toyota_yaris
01/04/2007;James;"While the size and design were hurdles in choosing it, the Yaris has proved me wrong. Quick, capable, and incredibly fuel efficient, the car has won me over. Even my tall (6'8"") friend was able to fit comfortably in the front seat on a long drive. The back seat is roomier than one might expect, and there are plenty of compartments to hold things. Definitely a good car to consider, if you don't carry a lot of people/goods on a general basis. Excellent commuter car.";toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
01/04/2007;william seidel;The Yaris is a top value in its class. It has awesome styling, surprising leg and head room. I can't imagine a better value out there.

12/26/2006;Happy Yaris Owner;Granted, I have owned this car for less than a week, but after a decently long trip for the holidays I feel I can give some helpful insight. For me the performance has been very acceptable. For a 1.5 liter engine it is peppy, quiet and smooth. The layout of the interior is not that quirky, but I do admit I like the sedan's interior better than the hatchback I tested - seems to be higher quality. The sound system is excellent and this is with the standard single CD AM/FM stereo. I got 40 mpg on my trip and think my opinion of this car will only get better with the miles.;Smooth engine, great gas mileage and nice sounding CD player.;toyota_yaris
12/24/2006;Lazybum101;My wife and I purchased this car in an effort to save a little money on gas, but not have to pay so much extra for a hybrid.

04/06/2009;ahviva;I was extremely excited to buy this car to replace my old Geo Metro. Although no fuel-driven car (and even many hybrids) comes close to Geo Metro's fuel efficiency, Yaris' record was good enough. Plus, I was looking to stay within the sub-compact category. I love it in every way except for two serious design flaws: 1. There's only ONE cup holder in the whole car, and it's positioned in a way that is utterly inconvenient. I have to reach quite far back, past the manual brake to be able to grab it. 2. If I adjust the seat so that I am comfortable reaching the pedals, I have to stretch my arms to reach the steering wheel. It makes it for a much less comfortable drive than I'd like to.;Spacious interior, smooth drive. ;toyota_yaris
04/03/2009;Trippmatic;While I haven't had my vehicle long enough to warrant an in depth review, thus far it has been a pleasure to drive and very good on fuel. I will not remark on its reliability except to say that it has 26000 miles on it so far and no reported maintenance other than tire repair and replacement. It is a great economy car, perhaps the best, when considering cost of maintenance, cost to drive, looks, ease of operation, and the fact that it is a Toyota.;Small and maneuverable, great fuel economy (40 MPG best, 34 MPG worst), comes with Aux input for the stereo (What's a CD?), and has OK exterior styling, plus good room for driver and passengers.;toyota_yaris
03/31/2009;stephanie;I've had this car for 2 years now, and all I've had to do is change the oil. I've put 32k miles on it. I used it for delivery driving for a while. It was great.

02/02/2009;louie;Its a nice little car. Great for small family or single folks. I had to get rid of it less than two years with it. The odometer, gas reading, dials etc in the middle is just too weird. Not very strong engine. Cup holders are one size and wrong spot to have it. Auxiliary plug is on passengers side. Too difficult too reach when on drivers side. Seats are uncomfortable and hard. Miles per gallon are 33 with city and highway. Side compartment storage in front too deep and thin. ;Gas efficient;toyota_yaris

12/20/2006;Michael;I can't recall the last time I found myself looking forward to driving; my Yaris makes my being on the road a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I can only echo others' comments regarding the Yaris' handling, fuel economy (I've been averaging 34 MPG as a city driver) and its inescapable head-turning likeability. I adapted quickly to the center-mounted instrument panel. Variety is the spice! I definitely recommend the Power Package if only for the power-lock amenity. The standard stereo setup that's included in this package is robust enough for me. Friends have all commented on the Yaris' deceptively roomy interior. It seats five, but four seems a more realistic number to expect. ;toyota_yaris
12/14/2006;katherine Weikle;I love my Yaris! It is metallic blue on the outside and has a black interior with metallic blue dots. Although it looks small, the Yaris hatchback is very roomy in the front and in the back seats. The Yaris is very convenient with its 20 compartments, 7 different cupholders and laydown-able back seat. You get used to the speedometer being in the middle of the dash quiet fast. The ride is smooth and the car is quiet. The power locks, windows and mirrors just adds to the experience. You are sure to love it as much as me!;The CD/ radio and extra iPod hook up is awesome. You get used to the speedometer being in the middle of the dash quite fast. The middle seat belt in the back is a 3 pointer but it can be tucked away with easy access later on if you want to put it away. ;toyota_yaris
12/13/2006;Jenn;"There are some things I would change, such as the manual seat adjusters and manual steering wheel adjuster (I was spoiled in my last car). My boyfriend likes when we take my car out some evenings (he has a large SUV), because we can park more easily and in smaller ""parking spaces"". You can hear the traveling noise at higher speeds, but that doesn't matter much to myself. Knowing that I get really good gas mileage makes up for that.";I love the speedometer and other gadgets in the middle. I really like where the cup holders are placed for the the front seat. I still show off my trunk space;toyota_yaris
12/13/2006;Jeff;I bought this car several weeks ago. I check other economy cars, and found the Yaris to offer the most in comfort and drive. The cup holders are not good, they are not where they belong, but the rest of the car, fit and finish and drive is suberb for a tiny car.;The car has great brakes, comfortable seats and a big back seat. The MP3 hookup is nice.;toyota_yaris
12/10/2006;jo;i just love this car, sporty, great on gas, very affordable;Sporty looks , and additional head room.;toyota_yaris
12/09/2006;Zanella;Couldn't be more happy with my Yaris. It drives well, and is very comfortable and reliable.;comfort, iPod AUX plug;toyota_yaris
12/08/2006;Danno;Just bought one for my daughter. I've been driving it until she comes home for Christmas break. great car, fun to drive. It's a great value and I wouldn't mind having one for myself.;Sounds like an old Triumph Spitfire as I go at highway speeds (in a good way). ;toyota_yaris
12/03/2006;Nicole;"I love my Yaris. I can't believe how much power this car has. It immediately gets up when I drive on the freeway and is truly amazing. This little vehicle has so much power!! It does have a little noise when I drive it, but that is one of the things I love about it. I feel like I am in a race. I nicknamed my Yaris, I call it a ""Bullet"" because it gets up and shoots out of nowhere. I am glad I purchased it before more people catch on how great this car really is.";A couple of my favorite features are the many compartments, and the tremendous space it provides.;toyota_yaris
12/01/2006;Ran Kizama;I traded in my 200WHP Mazdaspeed MX-5 because I was getting out of drifting and needed and fun yet practical daily driver. The Yaris was the best car to fit the bill. Fun to drive, excellent wheel response, and great MPG made the Yaris a prime choice. While it doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles as other cars such as the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit, it's not a 5-door station wagon like they are either. This 3-door compact has been nothing but fun since I got it and I've already began throwing on a variety of TRD Performance goodies that will keep my warranty intact. ;The center mounted dash is a nice touch once you get used to it. The auxiliary jack is great for users with an iPod. With over 21 storage compartments, I never need to find a place for something.;toyota_yaris
11/30/2006;michelle in valencia;"When I see another Yaris owner driving nearby, I just want to ""high-five"" them. The gas mileage is great, and it is NOT sluggish on the grapevine (you know what I mean) and the cupholders and aux jack are terrible but forgiveable. My friends all love it. However, if you're in the wind, just BE EXTRA CAREFUL. I came from a huge suv to this little car so just be aware that you can't drive it the same. U-turns are the best now. Parking? Yeah, buddy! Racing? Not so much. Toyota, if you're reading this, change a bunch of stuff!! Then give me another one! I heart Yaris!";Gas mileage, of course. The cuteness factor. Having the aux jack for the iPod. PRICE!! Roomy as heck. I can fit a couple of bodies in the trunk. Zippy in town. Not a hybrid but just a great gas mileage without paying double.;toyota_yaris
11/30/2006;marti;I was really surprised at the pickup and go this car has. Great on gas especially when you can only use regular. It sits up high so great when wearing dresses and great for seniors to get out of too. Very comfortable. Surprised at how fast it does go. It has a lot of room inside for my senior parents to get out with ease and comfortable for them. I love this car and so does my wallet when it comes to the gas. And it has a place for my coffee to sit that does not spill.;Gas mileage, comfort, ride, three glove boxes, drink holders, speed, size.;toyota_yaris
11/28/2006;testdrive;I searched for months for the best new small car. This Yaris is even better than the professional ratings. This car is energetic, maneuverable, gutsy, cheap to run, responsive, fun, good looking, quiet. Combines economy and power. Runs forever on $10 of gas.;Eye-catching styling. Good window styling. Everybody stares at this car! Sound system great. Light, but roomy plus lots of useful places to put personal items.;toyota_yaris
11/25/2006;ROBIN;I love our Yaris! It is great on gas and my 5 speed manual is fun to drive. I bought this car for my daughter who will be driving in another year. In the meantime I am driving it. Yaris has just enough room for my family of four and one family pet (our fifth person). ;The sedan body style and front end design. I also love the interior dash design.;toyota_yaris
11/22/2006;Kandice Kartchner;Yaris is a car that originally was introduced in Europe a few years ago, where I rented one and tried it out. I fell in LOVE with it, and wished that I could have one here in the states. Alas, the US had not approved them. (Perhaps the competition was just too much - so safe, fun, and amazing on gas.) Anyhow, when they came I had to see what they had done to them. It was utterly amazing! They are priced very reasonably. The hatchback has tons of space inside, innovative ideas & design features like three glove boxes, lots of safety, amazing handling & control, and nice interiors. I love driving it! It is really fun to drive, and very comfortable. I love the gas mileage and small size too!;My favorite features are the glove boxes for both driver and passenger, and the space saving ideas. I love how roomy it is, even with it being such a compact car. I love the flat folding backseat because I can put more in it than most cars can hold. It is great in lots of terrains and all weather.;toyota_yaris
11/21/2006;Liz;I purchased the car because it was cute and got good mileage. Everyone in my family is borrowing it because of the mileage. Even my son really likes it. maybe I should have it painted pink so it will stay in my driveway more often. I bought it to take the grandkids to and from school. I have never had so many people ask me about my Yaris. ;Looks, mileage, size.;toyota_yaris
11/21/2006;amy;When driving the Yaris you feel like an ice skater gliding over the ice. I have only had the car for 4 days but I know it's the best purchase I've ever made. The gas mileage is awesome as a commuter this will come in handy!!!;The stereo is awesome, The sound that come out is the best I have ever heard!!!;toyota_yaris
11/21/2006;Ed;Center gauges are quickly obtained, fully visible. Overall quality seems impressive for entry level auto. Chosen for quality, fuel economy, not price. Responsive, actually fun to drive. Full complement of airbags. A city car, not really large enough for constant high speeds.;Room for a small auto. Comfort for smaller users.;toyota_yaris
11/21/2006;Carroll Sorrell;Love my Yaris. Toyota in general has the best products for little old grannies that need reliability! I have a Toyo truck and I feel the same way about it. Always there when I need them and safe and fun to drive. Yaris has made Toyota proud. Keep up the good work.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
11/18/2006;john;My fiance saw this car and instantly fell in love with it. Previously had a 97 rav4. This little car is great, surprising power from the small engine. Great ride quality, and fuel mileage. Interior is pretty comfy, very roomy. Trans. does some weird things sometimes. Other than that, very smooth, quality feel for this little affordable car. Makes peoples head turn all the time, also sparks conversations. ;She loves the MP3 port, cup holders, and interior styling. Oh yeah and its cuteness factor. ;toyota_yaris
11/16/2006;jjrigadoon;We wanted an economical 2nd vehicle;" my daughter had purchased a Yaris sedan and loved it. We checked it out (high cute factor) and went with it for the great Toyota reputation and the fact that it won ""Car of the Year"" in Europe one year. It has turned into our 1st vehicle, not the 2nd. My husband and I both love to drive it, so the SUV sits in the driveway a lot. We got the 5 speed, manual. It has plenty of power... a requirement of mine for getting on the interstates.";toyota_yaris
11/14/2006;Pocket Rocket;I actually received this vehicle as a gift. So far, it has been one of the best cars that I've owned. It is a little sluggish on initial acceleration but what can I expect when I'm averaging 40 mpg! Ride is great, sticks to the road, handles very well. Fabulous sound system. Would like to see a higher center console for arm rest and cup holder is great... if you're left handed! ;I love everything about it!;toyota_yaris
11/12/2006;Kate Smith;I bought my Yaris a few weeks ago. I used to own a Hyundai Elantra and this is far better. When you are on the highway or in the city it really gets up and goes, unlike the Elantra. It gets great gas mileage and is super cute. The only thing I don't like about it are the cup holders. There are two for bottles in the doors, but the main center one is a bit too far back to be useful when you are driving.;The styling is geat and stands out. The fuel economy is more than wonderful.The handling is very nice and responsive. There are so many places to store things that there no longer any excuse to have a cluttered car. ;toyota_yaris
11/11/2006;Darryl;Im 63 so I wanted a cheap, basic, mileage car. I guess in my generation the basics are the basics. I don't need, cruise control, auto windows and all the rest. I did get air, stereo, power steering , five speed (dont need automatic). I also got gas mileage, that will come and go, though. I have gotten as low as 30.5 and as high as 39, it seems it's always this way, but this is honest mileage. Sticker mileage, brag mileage, and honest mileage. But the car is cute, rides good, mileage O.K. but it's NOT a turnpike cruiser with the goodies. I love it, 9.5 on a scale of 10. But over 40mph keep an eye on the speedo.;Well put together, mileage, ride, interior lights etc. all well done. FUN - FUN - FUN to drive!! ;toyota_yaris
11/06/2006;Dena;I've had my hatchback for a month now and I love it. This car is so much fun to drive. It's very roomy in the front seats for such a small car. So far I'm getting about 37 mpg which seems good to me. It's a little loud on the highway but feels very stable. I would have purchased the power package but it wasn't available in NH.;The zippy way it drives. The gas mileage. The stereo, it sounds great. ;toyota_yaris
11/06/2006;Dani;"This vehicle has been great so far. I make many trips back and forth from Iowa to Chicago and it is much nicer not having to fill up 3 times during the trip, instead I only have to fill up once and I still have 1/2 tank left when I get back. The only complaint I have about the vehicle is that the cup holders in front are directly in front of the heating vents so the drink gets really hot even if you close the vents. The vehicle looks small on the outside, but it has a ton of room on the inside, you would never expect that my fiance, who is 6' 4"", fits very comfortably in the passenger's seat! Overall, I definitely love the vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone!";I love all of the compartments! One of my favorites is in the side of the door where there is a bottle holder. You can fit a bottle in the door instead of having it wobble all around in the front cupholder.;toyota_yaris
11/05/2006;Lindsey;I got the Yaris because I needed something affordable and reliable. So far I am loving it. Feels great on the road and very fun to drive; I feel hip when I'm sporting around in it.;toyota_yaris
11/02/2006;Greg Warmoth;My Yaris is the 2 door hatchback, red with the 1.5 liter engine. It drives nice and smooth with little road noise. It seats 5 but more like 4. Don't expect to haul a lot of baggage but this is more for the commuters than hauling anything. Fuel economy is around 39 on the road, about what Toyota shows it at. The stereo is simple but works well. The gauges are in the middle of the dash so if anyone doesn't like the instruments being to their right to look at the speedometer than this wouldn't be the car for you. This is an economy car, no bells and whistles, but it's reliable at a cheaper price. Price of the car and gas mileage. ;Gas mileage, good looks. Reliable engine (1.5 liter).;toyota_yaris
11/01/2006;Carrie Livingston;My husband and I just purchased this car for me to drive all over the state for my clinicals. I've only driven it a day and already love it. It handles very well and gets great gas mileage. This car is so roomy on the inside. I traded in my Escort for this and some how it's shorter in length but much bigger on the inside, no one has to sit with their knees in their chest to have enough leg room. It's taking a little getting used to looking at the speedometer in the center, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.;Roomy interior, MP3 player plug in, adjustable seat height.;toyota_yaris
10/30/2006;steven;For the money there is nothing better. Fantastic gas mileage, turns on a dime, rides like a expensive sedan. Great looks, classy radio sound. Fits five adults. Just take it out for a drive you'll love it. Only drawback is getting used to the speedometer, it's in the middle of the dash. It took me a couple of weeks to get used to it. Get the power package, it's worth the cost. Toyota has a real winner here. If you are looking for a reliable car that gets great mileage and is fun to drive don't pass this car up.;Price, looks, gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
10/28/2006;Robert Moore;The Yaris handles great and has lot of room on the interior. The motor responds perfectly. There is more road noise than what I am used to. I love this car and plan to customize it into a pimped ride.;dohc and the vvt.;toyota_yaris
10/24/2006;RayC;As someone who's had every imaginable vehicle, this was quite a radical move. My very first foreign car! What a life change this has been. From an overhaul of my driving experience to reducing my monthly gas bill by 60%, it's been quite a ride. I love this car.;MPG (of course). Handling. Interior comfort and convenience;toyota_yaris
10/23/2006;Holly;"I wanted a new car with great fuel economy and a 1980s-era price tag. My bright red 2-door liftback automatic is an adorable head-turner that more than doubled my previous MPG. It sits a little higher off the ground so getting in and out is easy, and the front seat area is remarkably spacious. It feels ""big"" on the inside. For the price I expected a ""less substantial"" car, but was surprised at its grippy feel of the road and responsive handling on curves. A $20 cable from Circuit City allowed me to stream my iPod through the radio. Passenger-side airbag sensor activates the airbag based on weight. Overall a thoughtful design and intelligent vehicle at a realistic price.";Just plain fun to drive! I was expecting more putt-putt and got more vroom!;toyota_yaris
10/22/2006;jeng7722;I just bought my Yaris yesterday after having a ford focus for 2 years. What a difference!! I love the shape of the car. toyota has used all the compact space really well. drive is smooth and Gas milage is awesome! i love it.;Sleek design, gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
10/20/2006;Jason Lynch;I really am enjoying my Yaris. It is all I expected. I am getting great gas milage, I do mixed driving, getting 34-38 MPG. It is fun to drive and is cute. I first saw this car in Ireland about 2 years ago and was excited to see it State side when I needed a new car. I don't think it well sell well in America do to our lack of logic when it comes to cars. I love the car.;Design, gas milage;toyota_yaris
10/18/2006;Bob Wickline;"I am 6'6"" tall and I fit just fine in this vehicle. I look forward to driving it. Not only do I love this particular car but I believe Toyota makes the best cars on the road. I love the simplicity of the controls and the conveniences designed into the dash and doors. It handles extremely well. I was looking for a comuter car and this is just perfect for my needs.";Simple controls to use for heat,air conditioning etc. Love the room. Seats are very firm and supportive for my back. I like the ease of getting in and out of the vehicle.;toyota_yaris
10/18/2006;Tine;I purchased my Yaris at the end of August 2006. It's given me no problems, it is fun to drive and I love the 657 million compartments. The little extras like MP3 hookup are great!;MP3 hookup and the cupholders.;toyota_yaris
10/18/2006;Lori;I've had my car now for 2 months and I can't believe the great gas mileage I get. It's fun to drive, small yet roomy (NOT for big people though) so far, I'm loving it! I'm a bit anxious to see how it handles in the SNOW! ;no 'favorites';toyota_yaris
10/17/2006;Nate;I bought the car for price and MPG, also because I haven't seen many around. It was a must to get the S package and a must to get the manual transmission for it's performance. I got the tan (bisque) interior which I think steps it up a notch from the dark alternative. I feel like I'm driving a mini Camry which is my next car in a few years.;The responsiveness of the manual transmission. The dash setup is a fresh look. I feel like a sit up a little higher which gives me a better view of the road. Big trunk for the size of the car. It's an awesome little car that I would recommend to anyone entering the Toyota world.;toyota_yaris
10/16/2006;Karen;I bought my Yaris about 2 months ago and so far it is meeting all my expectations. The dealer only had one lift-back and one sedan on the lot the day I was there. I chose the lift-back over the sedan because I didn't want a car that looked like every other car out there. This car is different - it draws a lot of attention. I love that this car is roomy and comfortable to drive. Compared to my last 2-dr this car is easy to get in and out of the back seat. I am getting around 35 mpg and hope for better as I continue to break her in - but even if 35 is the best I get it beats my last car by 10 mpg so I'll take it! It's a lot of car for the size and the price. Very satisfied.;Love the look, inside and out. It's comfortable, gets great gas mileage, and it's a breeze to park, even in the smallest spots. Love the cargo area - plenty of room.;toyota_yaris
10/16/2006;maximapitko;My wife and I were on the market for a new vehicle for over a month. A long story short - we bought the Yaris and although my wife says she had a little buyers remorse, I had NONE. My impressions so far: it was sluggish at first but 5000 miles later it's a different car. The mpgs are between 37 and 43. It seems like the AC doesn't affect the fuel consumption at all. At first the car seems a little cheaply made but it grows on you tremendously. 1st, 3rd and 5th gear are EVIL! The only thing I would change is firm up the suspension and put slightly wider tires - the car doesn't like to take corners fast. Advice - always break in your new car (3000 rpm MAX for the first 5000 miles). Thks.;Build quality, white gauge cluster, tranny, soft pedals, steering feel, 40mpgs, 105 hp and only 2250 pounds = many surprised faces at the stoplight, interior and trunk space.;toyota_yaris
10/15/2006;Ang;Hello Yaris! I needed a small commuter after 95K miles of long distance traveling on my old job. I have put 1000 miles on my new '07 Yaris and I have no regrets. Getting 35 mpg combined city/hwy, love the velvety smooth 5-speed, electronic steering (so easy for city parking), peppy pick up, great handling. Thought I would hate the center speedo but I love it at night, no glaring speedo in front of you. Yaris gets me lots of looks - never thought a car could be cute, but this is! ;Price, gas mileage, low maintenance, driver's glove box, cup holders, build quality, great 5-speed tranny, electronic steering (no steering fluid to check), secure handling w/15-inch wheels, easy to park in city and most of all, it's cute!;toyota_yaris
10/12/2006;KIM;I have really enjoyed my Yaris. It has great gas mileage and is pretty sporty and quick for a small car. I purchased the car for the fuel mileage but really like the car. I get a lot of looks in the car because everyone thinks it is a Hybrid. I average over 40 mpg when traveling on the highway to work on a daily basis.;I love the gas mileage and the extra storage compartments.;toyota_yaris
10/11/2006;iota84jrock;I was looking for a vehicle that was fuel efficient for the commute to work (75 miles rd trip). I put a deposit on my sedan around the beginning of August. Prior to that, I went to about 5 dealerships and could not find a sedan that had the power package. After narrowing my focus down to one dealership. I had them search for a sedan with the power package. They located one coming into the port of NY that had everything I was looking for in addition to side/curtain airbags and keyless entry. They informed me that it would take about 4 weeks to arrive. My Yaris was delivered to the dealership in about 3 weeks. After declining all the dealer-installed options, I happily took possession. ;-fuel economy -easy to maneuver -fun to drive (peppy) -looks from people who don't know what kind of car it is ;toyota_yaris
10/10/2006;tom giambra;I was looking at the fit and did not feel like waiting a month or longer plus paying a nine hundred dollar premium .Iam glad I bought Yaris drives like a big car 38 mpg first fill up mixed driving;Ithink it is a much better looking car than honda and nissan. excelent mpg;toyota_yaris
10/10/2006;Clarence S;The car is a lot of fun to drive, gives a big car feel on the road and handles great around town. Everything has met my expectations for the vehicle. Gas mileage has been great..;Love the 4 cupholders in front and 3 in the back.. Never too many... Once you touch the starter it automatically engages until started.;toyota_yaris
10/07/2006;Joanna;I just got the car today straight from Japan, and loved it so much inside and outside that I was not able to part from it and went without food for 7 hours. I was chosing between Chevy Aveo, Nissan Versa and Honda Fit. After long and careful research, I've decided that Toyota Yaris is the most economical and best looking option. I got my Yaris absolutely red, with power package, all weather guard package, keyless entry, ABS, automatic transmission, 60/40 split. I originally ordered blue, but aparently those are harder to get, but once I saw the red I never looked back. I am looking forward to the excelent gas mileage!!;Cool glove compartaments, bottle holders even on the back, back reclining seats, windshield wiper, very comfortable seats, awesome audio and speakers, suspension is comperable to those higher costing cars, car drives so smoothly that I didn't even notice I was going 60mh!;toyota_yaris
10/04/2006;Bonnie;This Yaris is a great driving little car and handles like a dream. I've enjoyed driving it, especially since it has great pick up and can get out in traffic with no problem whatsoever.;Center mounted speedometer.....it's cool.;toyota_yaris
10/03/2006;I LOVE MY YARIS;Very affordable, Cute design and shape, very spacious. This Car is Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!;Cup Holdsters, Dash Design, Spacious, Driving and control - Excellent.;toyota_yaris
10/01/2006;MARK;Do you want to get at fuel manufactures? Yaris is the answer. Two days ago,i traveled 525 miles with one tank. To fill up, at fuel price $2.48 at costco. Total little less than $28.00. Wow!!!... The wife and i bought last one at the dealership. Salesman, told us, that the dealership can not order them fast enough. As soon as they come in,they're gone. Highly recommend it. If your a camary owner, leave your camary at home. Use your camary for the weekends,and your yaris for commuting. Get yours right now,before they're all gone. Sell your mercedes, and buy a yaris for each member of your immediate family. Have fun enjoy the savings with your yaris,and spend the extra money wisely.;all;toyota_yaris
09/26/2006;Dawn;Looks are deceiving, you can comfortably fit 5 adults in this thing! I chose the Yaris because of MPG and price, and when I got to the dealer I bought it because of looks and ride. The manual tranny is super easy to shift, and I love the way it turns on a dime.;Very Stylish with the body kit and fog lights. Cup holders are placed right near A/C vents so your drinks never get warm (it sounds weird but its a great feature when youre used to your drinks getting warm) The radio is nice too. Comfy seats!!! ;toyota_yaris
09/25/2006;Chris;I purchased this Yaris 2 doors liftback for a restaurant delivery use. So far fuel consumption is not what Toyota states between 34-39. Mine is average 19 MPG. It's half of what it states. This is the only thing I feel bad about it.;Style is good. Very eye catching car. Excellent handling.;toyota_yaris
09/22/2006;Susan;I have just purchased a new car. So far I have enjoyed driving it and the gas I am saving is great. I would recommend this car to everyone.;Low gas mileage. ;toyota_yaris

09/21/2006;Jeff;I was looking for a commuter car that was well built, comfortable, good on gas, and I wouldn't be ashamed to drive. I went looking for a Corolla, but when I saw the Yaris, I had to drive it; when I drove it, I had to have it! Good on gas, comfortable, peppy, great visibility, stylish, and fun. Love the five speed. The optional 15 inch tires make for a smooth, stable ride. WIth the AC and a CD player, it's everything I wanted and more! And the price . . . :);toyota_yaris
09/21/2006;Toyota Yaris;"Very fun to drive. No other car can match the price with as much as the Yaris offers. I disagree with the reveiws of the Yaris in respect to the reveiw says and I quote ""Yaris has a slow-off-the line acceleration."" For there only being 106 horses under the hood the Yaris is extremely powerful for a 4-cylinder. Anyone looking for a car that is reliable, comfortable, fuel-effiecient, and last but not least a car that will last a long long time. An interesting side note: Toyota has the highest resale value of any auto manufacturer.";The gauges in the middle is pretty awesome. It also has a powerful factory stereo system. Slap shift gear lever is also neato.;toyota_yaris
09/21/2006;Don Thomas;Insurance costs lowered, handles and steering very tight and can turn on a dime. ;Steering, Dash board;toyota_yaris
09/18/2006;Dale A. Drottar;I write a review earlier, immediately after buying the car. Having owned it for a month, the only obvious fault I have experienced with it is the quality of the front part of the seat back on the drivers seat. The polyester cloth has worn/frayed where I enter/exit the vehicle. Apparently my belt and belt loop has worn the cloth on the lower left of the driver's seat. I tried to contact Toyota through the computer help line with no results. The seat was worn with less than 500 miles on the car. I am thin and in good shape, my weigh has nothing to do with the poor quality material being used. Dealership will try and help me, I hope. Rain always drips in the windows, rain shields a must.;Great turning radius, great gas milage, gotta laugh when you look at it. Very peppy.Interior controls easily used.;toyota_yaris
09/15/2006;Padrooga1;I bought the Yaris Liftback, because I needed a car. Shopping around at slightly used cars I decided I could buy a new one (Yaris) for the price of the used. The Yaris was just being introduced and gas prices were rising. Those were big factors for me in purchasing this vehicle. This is my first foreign car that I've ever owned. I also choose a foreign vehicle because of the reliability. I plan to drive this vehicle for many years. The ride is wonderful, I fill the tank 2 times a month. It rides smoothly for a small car and you really feel like your riding in a big car. I also like all the airbags and saftey options this car has! ;Ease of getting in the vehicle. The back door (3'd) is at the perfect height for ease of putting stuff in and taking stuff out. The indoor lights that come on after you shut the car off are cool. The look of the interior is sleek!;toyota_yaris

09/15/2006;Ivan;"Replacement for my '88 Corolla FX HB after it blew up. This automatic 2 dr LB is a perfect commuter car for me - point A to B with no nonsense. Plenty of room-I take it to Costco. Parks almost anywhere and turning radius is awesome. Although pricy,$16K out the door, but I really wanted auto windows & doorlocks. I'm 6'4"" and there are very few cars, even full size, that'll accomodate me. In this car my head, legs, knees, and elbows have room to spare. Major complaint - rated at 39MPG yeah right, at 1500 miles I'm only averaging 34 which is great but I only drive freeway with very little stop and go & follow all the recommendations to get better mileage but haven't gotten to 39MPG as others.";Seats, love the side turning blinkers, sound system, funky little helper windshield wiper (front), Blazing Blue color, roomy, center panel is weird but who cares, I rarely look at it - too busy going 80MPH;toyota_yaris
09/14/2006;Astronskas;I just bought this car and cannot say enough how much I enjoy this vehicle. The gas mileage is truly awesome and the handling is great. The only negative I have found so far is that the gas and brake pedal are a little to close together for a person with larger feet, but I have adjusted to it. Overall I am very impressed with the value for my money.;Speedometer and Tachometer in the center console of the vehicle. Illumination of the control panel.;toyota_yaris
09/12/2006;cathy t;"I just love this car. If you've ever driven a Camry, this is just a scaled down version of one, in my opinion. With the 15"" wheels, it hugs the curves and has good acceleration. I was going 80mpg and never realized it. That's part of the Toyota experience. You can't go wrong with anything built by Toyota.";Small on the outside, roomy on the inside. Full size trunk. Handles beautifully with plenty of zip. A real fun car to drive.;toyota_yaris
09/09/2006;Kelly Robinson;I really enjoy my Yaris, I get great gas milage and It is a great car for anyone that doesn't want to pay that much for great quality;The i-pod hook up and the gas savings!;toyota_yaris
09/07/2006;yaris1;I traded in my 2000 echo and im just so happy with my choice the car is great looks good [got mine in nautical blue] every where i go people ask about it i havent got to high 30's in fuel economy but been averaging 33 with ac on in closing i think the car is just what i wanted;Styling especially the nose inside nice;toyota_yaris
09/05/2006;lbstrgrl1;I love my Yaris. This is my fourth Toyota and I will never buy anything else. This econo car has it all... Looks, Performance, and Reliability. It sure doesn't look and act like an econo car.;MP3 aux;toyota_yaris
09/04/2006;RT;Being my first car, I first decided on buying the Yaris for its great price, cute looks and awesome mileage. I drive ~26 miles/day and have been averaging 36mpg. The acceleration is a little sluggish while raising from 0-20 but after that no complaints! It took me a day to get used to the centered dashboard, but now..I like this better that the conventional behind-the-steering placing. I feel that this way, my eyes are not completely off the road while glancing at the speedometer.;centered dashboard, auxillary inline port for my IPod, awesome mileage, cute appearance;toyota_yaris
09/04/2006;cornell;Just to start off with this is my fourth toyota that i have driven since 1970 [my first toyota corolla hatchback}. I kept this one 7 years and sold it to my friend for 75.00 and he kept it for two more years, the only thing in all the years that i changed was a transmission because i was a new driver in 1970 and was a little rough, i had a manual trans. I have since had a tercel, echo, and presntly driving a Yaris which i adore and the style i love especialy the interior, my car is a blue royal and inside is black which looks really sleek.My car is and untill toyota shows me that that can not continue to build reliable and fuel efficient cars i will die being a toyota consumer, ; Interior design , and dynamic hood;toyota_yaris
08/31/2006;Johnnybud;I have had my automatic sedan for 90 days and have put on 9k miles. I am getting a blended 39 MPG and on the highway I am getting 44-45. Unreal, this is with an automatic also. This is a great car... well built, a great commuter car. I love my yaris.;Great transmission, Handling, ipod aux. jack.;toyota_yaris
08/27/2006;atlantikia;So far i have about 8k miles on my 5 speed Yaris, and I have to say I love it. Nice pick up off the line and a smooth ride. It won't perform like a camry, but it's also half the price. It's the best car you'll find at this price point.;Cubby holes and cup holders, ample inside space, quirky design gets a lot of turning heads;toyota_yaris
08/26/2006;ken;The car is fun to drive and it's price is reasonable. ;I get close to 45 mil/gal on highway;toyota_yaris
08/26/2006;Beto Domin;I was trying to get a car with high MPG and lowers costs with lots of fun and quality and bought the Yaris hatchback. After few weeks, I noticed that some of the interior materials are of questionable quality. Also, once I'm on a highway at more than 55 MPH, I need to grab the steering with 2 hands as it feels unsecure, even worst at crosswinds. I'm not getting the MPG advertised and I'm not a heavy footer. All In all my expectations were high and I'm ready to trade in.;Easy on gas.;toyota_yaris
08/23/2006;AladdinSane;"I test drove a Yaris Liftback after seeing one parked near my home recently. It's ""da bomb"", so to speak. I liked what I saw. The one parked nearby was white on white, brand new, and I fell in love with it immediately. I'm aiming to get mine, if I go with it, in Blazing Blue Metallic. My Lady dug it too. It's a winner!!!";The liftback design, for one, makes this machine so versatile. . .much more so than the sedan, which I find too conventional looking. Of course I speak for myself on that.;toyota_yaris
08/22/2006;Jenny;Got my baby a few weeks ago. Getting over 40 miles to the gallon, mixed freeway and town driving. Fun, fun, fun, cute, cute, cute. Surprisingly, lots of space inside, feels very roomy. It is very zippy, corners well. Sound system is great, very handy to plug my MP3 player in. No more carting around my CD case. I got a red one. I actually wanted blue, but the little critters are so hard to find. Plus, they sell the moment they are put on the lot. Great buy for the money, plus the Toyota name. I highly recommend this car.;That nifty glove box on the driver's side, the adapter for my MP3 player, total look of the car, inside and out.;toyota_yaris
08/22/2006;Kristine;We bought our Yaris about a week ago and so far couldn't be happier with it. I get excellent mileage on my commute to work and the car handles great and is very roomy on the inside despite being a small vehicle. I would highly recommend this car if you are looking for a small, affordable car, with great gas mileage and a very nice and roomy interior design!;Cupholders close to dashboard level rather then down below, very nice handling, and great gas mileage!;toyota_yaris
08/22/2006;sackie;I bought my Yaris as an automatic only because the buyers haven't given consideration to people who want one with power package, and a manual transmission. I love control and the manual trans. rocks. There are a few annoying rattles from under the dash, and hopefully the dealer will take care of it, without having to take it apart. The sound system rocks, as they've improved the sensitivity to discriminating ears. I haven't found the magic way to get good gas mileage... maybe turning the car off, while coasting down a hill will help. All in all, I still love my Toyota Yaris!;Placement of the dash/controls, roominess of the seating areas, styling.;toyota_yaris
08/20/2006;Scott;Traded a 2005 MiniCooper S for this car. I have no regrets. It's not a Mini, but it's alot closer than you might think. Handling is very good. Manual tranny gives it lots of pep. I LOVE all the nooks (3 glove boxes!). It looks great. Fits 4 adults, no problem (plus suitcases in the 'trunk'). I'd recommend this to anyone.;Peppy, great milage (40MPG+), excellent interior (roomy!), CHEAP and well built. It doesn't get much better than this.;toyota_yaris
08/19/2006;Jenn;I bought my 2007 Yaris Hatchback in the end of May 2006. Thus far, I love it. Easy to drive, and much more room than you would think by looking at it. If you are comparing this vehicles to others, don't just look at reviews, go out and test drive this car. The mileage is great and I always have people rolling down their windows and asking how many miles I get to the gallon. Overall, I would give this car a 10 out of 10. ;I love all the glove compartments, the aux. port for my MP3 player and also the interior design on the seats.;toyota_yaris
08/19/2006;Dale;Well, I just bought the odd car 2 days ago so the above evaluation is probably premature but accurate for as long as I had the car! I traded my Tacoma in, and I've always had a truck, and at age 56, this is a new experience! I wanted the smallest, ugliest great gas mileage vehicle I could afford... and bingo... here's the Yaris! Roomy inside, plenty of pep, and fun, yes, fun to drive. I have the 5 speed, and it's a riot to drive! Only drove it approximately 125 miles so far, but it looks like that will cost me around 10 bucks to fill up. Whew! I was getting tired of always looking at the gas gauge. And the Tacoma was a 4 cylinder getting around 20 mpg! Don't like the daytime driving lights, though.;Pretty nice sound system, easy handling, roomy inside.;toyota_yaris
08/19/2006;sarah2037;I went out just to look at the car and drove away in it. I couldn't resist it. The car is hip, stylish and gets great mileage. Don't be fooled by the size, it can still fit 4 comfortable and the back seats move so easily for extra storage. ;The hatchback makes it so easy to put things away in. Also the cupholders and hidden compartments are very nice. When I first bought the car I thought the gauges being in the center of the dash would be hard to get used to, but really they are easier to view.;toyota_yaris
08/19/2006;Jose E. Felix;This is my fourth Toyota car, after my Runner '95, Tercel '98, Corolla '03. Driving it is a lot of fun! It's smooth on the road, the engine is quite silent and powerful when needed. Because of its size, it's really easy to park, even in the smallest of places. You can go anywhere comfortably and the seats give lots of options. It's roomy and modern. ;Among this car's many features I have to mention its fuel economy, its cool shape, the auxiliary feature on the sound system, antenna placement, awesome interiors, power steering (thank you!), futuristic dashboard and the many storage places.;toyota_yaris
08/19/2006;Bonnie;This is a sweet driving little car. I love the way it handles and the way it sips gas. It's a winner for everyone!;Gauges in the middle - nice change, easy to see.;toyota_yaris
08/18/2006;Tyler;The fit and finish on my liftback was better than expected (even for a Toyota). The doors sound firm and heavy when shut. I am a long time Honda owner (6 total). I think I just converted. The seats are quite comfortable for what is described as entry level. They have enough side stability to keep you in place around tight turns. I fit two- 220+ lb, 6 ft adults in the back seat for an hour ride with no problem. The manual transmission is very responsive and sounds like it should be driven at a higher rpm in 2nd and 3rd compared to what I expected (a tach would be nice). Freeway on ramp acceleration with the manual is quite good. You can u turn on a residential street with feet to spare.;Oil filter is in a great place. Front cupholders directly in front of the a/c vents to cool my drinks (sorry to the coffee drinkers). Stability at 65 MPH. The seats feel of good quality, unlike other entry level cars. Shoulder belt for the middle rear passenger can easily be used by smaller children.;toyota_yaris
08/17/2006;mwc115;"I like it. I'm 6'7"" about 270 lbs, and I truly enjoy it and fit comfortably, if that says anything about the interior. It lacks power but makes up for it in gas mileage. It is also fun to drive, gets around great, and the sedan makes you wonder how there is that much space in such a small car. It is a great little commuter car and I get everything I expected to get out of it. They are hard to find. I had to get the base model and lack of keyless entry is making me nuts, but can be added. Cup holders and speedometer placement are... different and take getting used to. I'm picky so I replaced the speakers after 1 day, and it was not an easy processes.";Interior space is great. The trunk is surprisingly roomy. For a small engine it zips around well on the highway through traffic at 80 MPH. I think it rides and handles great;toyota_yaris
08/16/2006;LINDIE;I love my little car, it gets wonderful gas mileage. I have taken it up the mountain passes many times, and it cruises nicely up them all.;It's a cute design. I have gotten many comments on the exterior looks. Inside the truck has a lot of room for all my grandchildrens things.;toyota_yaris
08/16/2006;barb;I have had this car for four months, great buy, love the mpg. Like the small car payment. Easy and comfortable to drive. Love the stereo system and the dash. ;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
08/10/2006;Brian;Love this car, first tank from dealer, got 401 miles, wasnt sure how many gal they had put in, but with a 11.1 gal tank I knew I was close to 40 mpg. Let the last bar start flashing before I filled tank, drove 5 miles while it flashed, stuffed 10.6 gal in the tank and took off, I work a midnight shift which is an advantage with traffic, as in I rarely have to stop. 100 mile round trip, lite traffic, and this tank I did not use this A.C. keep that in mind, kept it as close to speed limit as possible, very rare to go over 70 mph, this car love to go 60 mph, anyway I made one tire pressure adjustment from 29 lbs (dealer) to 35 lbs. Drove the 10.6 gals for 449 miles for 42.3 mpg. Love it! ;Gas mileage;toyota_yaris
08/07/2006;Lauren;This car is just another example of Toyota's great products. The Yaris has an awesome turning radius - I can turn around in a two lane street with just barely edging on a driveway. For a 4cyl it can get you to whatever speed you need just fine. I consistently get 38/44 mpg city/highway. Seats are very comfortable w/ plenty of leg room - in front and in back. The folddown seats have already come in handy for college trips. I love the mp3/cd player & AUX jack. I didn't buy the power pkg to save money & I am just fine with my decision thus far. Everyone is impressed with they way my Yaris looks inside and out. I feel like I'm driving an expensive BMW the way some people look at me.;Turning radius, gas mileage, new center dashboard, trunk space, fold down seats, smooth ride for an economy car, mp3 player, decent speakers, the gear shift is neat and very useful - it's easy to shift to neutral at stops, or drive in D3 around town to save on even more gas.;toyota_yaris
08/07/2006;Anna;AMAZING car. I drive more on the gas conservative-side and I get 39 mpg in the CITY (yes, that's for the full tank of gas, not just one trip)! If I remember correctly I got about 45 mpg highway with no effort. My mom has a Corolla and there really isn't a substantial difference in interior space, nor trunk space. I like the new dashboard and how it is positioned in the middle; it's more visible and allows for more visibility out the windshield. I recommend this car to anyone who has a family of 4 or less, looking to save money on gas, like to be comfortable, and have all the reliability you could ask for from Toyota. What are you waiting for?!;toyota_yaris
08/06/2006;Abby Roberts;The car fits anywhere I want to park it, and it's extremely eye-catching. Looks more expensive than it is! Smooth ride on the road, very good brakes - slows down quickly. A/C is great! I love the CD/MP3/WMA player. My parents bought the Yaris Sedan and suggested I get one. Then I got the S. I absolutely love it. ;Fits in any spot. Great MPG! Very very roomy inside, despite small size outside. Lots of trunk room! ;toyota_yaris
08/04/2006;PC;I love my Yaris, I have the 4-door sedan with automatic trans. Barcelona Red Metallic, with the B. Power Package. I live on the freeway and it is a dream to drive. It is an awesome investment.;Exterior, it has a high cute/sporty factor! The titanium wheels are cool. I like the speedometer in the center and the interior trim. Also, the aux plug for iPod is great. NO ASHTRAY!! Awesome. Gas mileage is very good along with a lot of get up and go for such a small engine. ;toyota_yaris
08/03/2006;rebecca;I have had this car for about 2 months and it is a very reliable and comfortable vehical. It's terrific on gas and has run so far excellent. With the gas prices as elevated as they are and for the cost of purchasing this vehicle hands down a great money saving purchase. I absolutely love it. The Toyota Yaris is the next best thing next to the hybrid, for all of us earth savvy people who care about the environment!;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
08/02/2006;Ben;I would say that even though this car is a bit sluggish off the line, it makes up for it in second and third gear and I have to slow down to keep from going too fast at 60 to 80 mph. I do get pushed around on the interstate or with gusty winds, but laugh at the SUV drivers and their gas mileage. It is a fun car to drive and the only thing that I wished was driiferent after driving it for a month is the high beam indicator not being able to dim with the dash lights. Fun to drive and great on gas and plenty of room. I change my rating to an overall 10.;gas mileage and interior design;toyota_yaris
08/01/2006;justrobert;I love this little commuter. I must not be as picky as some because I love driving this car. My other vehicle is an 06 Pathfinder, the reason for this purchase. My wife needed the suv, not me I love my Yaris.;Gas mileage, dash, different little car, plus I can park it any where.;toyota_yaris
07/30/2006;kilasumowrestler;Great first new car. Gas and insurance friendly. ;It's cute and suprisingly spacious.;toyota_yaris
07/29/2006;cherie;I just love this little car, great get up and go and mileage is better than what dealer states. I get 45 miles to gallon hwy, 40 city. I can go to the beach and not worry about spending 55.00 to fill up the truck. Plenty of leg room so you don't feel cramped, only 1 thing I wish I had is cruise - when it comes available i will get that installed. Other from that great buy for the money.;Gas mileage 45 hwy 40 city, smooth ride for a small car.;toyota_yaris
07/29/2006;Chris;"This is a good example of Toyota quality for a reasonable entry level price. In this day of increasing fuel prices this is an exccellent commuter car. My car has 15"" tires and the ride is considerably better than one would imagine with a small car. The back seats slide fore and aft to create either more leg room, or more cargo room, a nice feature at any price point. A/C is standard and the electric power steering is the best yet. For those who care, you can connect your iPod to the center console. It takes a little getting used to to have a center gauge stack, but the resultant three gloveboxes are worth it. The EPA sticker is accurate, which is nice for a change!";toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
07/28/2006;technadyne;"My 2007 Toyota Yaris has CA license Plates ""My Yaris"" if you see me, feel free to say hi! This car is fantastic. It's a fully loaded 4 door automatic sedan that connects not only to my iPod but also any other MP3 player. IT'S AWESOME! This is a great car, but I can't wait for the 2010 Yaris because I'm sure its going to only get better with the progression of time. I can't wait for my Yaris to have satellite navigation like the one in the UK! CHEERS!!!!";All the little cubby places, performance & the AC is really powerful (BRR).;toyota_yaris
07/25/2006;maggie; I am thrilled with my Yaris!! It is stylish, comfortable, fun to drive and economical! Of course, with gas prices being what they are these days I wouldn't mind being able to claim about 10 miles per gallon more than what I am now recording. However, 38/39 m.p.g. on the freeways and 32/33 m.p.g. in-town driving isn't too shabby considering it's the summer months and I'm driving with the air-conditioner on full blast! I think I got a great deal on my 2007 Yaris. ;I like both the interior and exterior style of the 2007 Yaris. There is ample interior room in this sub-compact due to the ingenuity of it's design and I especially enjoy the back seat that folds forward providing additional space.;toyota_yaris
07/24/2006;boen;At nearly 40 mpg this car is a commuters dream. If the steering wheel were two inches further away from the dash it would be perfectly comfortable for a tall guy like myself. All else is great.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
07/24/2006;number55;I am 16 years old and this is possibly the best car I could have gotten. It's reliable and high mpg. I know it'll last me until I'm 30. It has excellent handling and all the perks with the power package make it luxurious. ;everything;toyota_yaris
01/23/2009;yara;Loved my Yaris. Cute, small, easy to park anywhere, and easy to drive. Fit a very tall family of four fine. Only problem was that it got blown all over the road when it was windy. Not a problem in places with little wind, but here, especially in snow or ice with wind, it was a problem. It was totaled this weekend (hit in the front driver side tire at about 30 mph), but I (the driver) was not injured. ;Gas mileage;toyota_yaris
01/19/2009;bigdoglover;I've had my Yaris for about a year and a half now and she is comfy and sure sips the fuel. I average about 33 mpg in the winter and about 38 mpg in the summer. I love the cupholders in my little car! I have my backseat down all of the time and my lab jumps right in for her rides. Wish it was more comfy for long trips though.;Cupholders!;toyota_yaris
01/06/2009;Jill;I love everything about this car except the lack of power and maneuverability on snow - it likes to slip, slide, and get stuck in a couple inches of snow pretty easily (I live in Wisconsin). In non-snow and non-icy conditions, it drives smoothly and has plenty of pep for the size. I love the way it looks inside and out. It is roomier than it would appear from the outside. The cupholders are extremely handy - better placed than any other car I have owned. Best of all, I get excellent gas mileage - overall I get around 34-35 mpg, but on a long all-highway trip I am able to get 38. That's hard to beat with a non-hybrid - and this car is comfortable! I would highly recommend this vehicle overall!;Placement of the cupholders, adjustable driver's seat (up, down, forward and back), excellent gas mileage, comfortable, reliable, very roomy for a compact car.;toyota_yaris
01/04/2009;Jeff;When I bought my Yaris in 2006, I posted a quick review. I wanted to follow after 2.25 years and 40k miles. I commute 36 miles one way to work in often heavy traffic. The Yaris is great for this. It stops quickly, and starts quickly. For maintenance, so far I have changed the oil and air filters and replaced the front tires. If I keep my speed around 60 (the speed limit, btw), I get over 40 mpg; real nice when gas was $4 per gallon. When we go to lunch, my colleagues like to pile in just to ride in it. I still love the car and highly recommend it. ;toyota_yaris
12/29/2008;love/haterealtionshp;I've had my Yaris for a little over a year and a half. Amazing gas mileage one of the things I love, it's got quite a lot of oomph when you want it. I think it's probably best as a tuner car. I don't recommend it as a family sedan though, unless you have snow tires on it, it slides everywhere in the winter, the car's too light for decent winter driving. Also I'm expecting and am very afraid to put my child in the car, I've seen them get totaled at 15 mph. As much as I do love this little car, I hate it at the same time, wish it was safer. As it stands with a little one on the way I'm searching for something else. It'll make me sad to see it go, but I gotta do what's best for my family.;She moves. ;toyota_yaris
12/20/2008;Eric;We bought this car new, our first car, when we just got married. The car has served us well. We have not had one single issue with the car in 42,000 miles. Have not even had to replace the brakes. This car returns mpg numbers up to 39 on the highway, 36 in mixed driving, 34 city in warm weather. In the winter, we avg 33 mixed. The interior design and quality are good, but the seating position front and rear are very upright, which on trips an hour or more becomes quite apparent. It is also very narrow inside. Automatic transmission has been flawless. This car basically needs no major maintenance til 100,000 miles, not even spark plugs or tranny fluid change. A great first car.;Reliability, perfect engine, MPG, MP3 and aux audio jack;toyota_yaris
12/13/2008;Cesar;I took the car to Las Vegas and San Diego almost brand new; the car gave around 43 miles per gallon going 65 MPG average. It is very comfortable considering the size of the car. My wife uses the car to daily commute to work and she loves it.;toyota_yaris
11/22/2008;veewhitehead88;I bought my Yaris a year before it became the model year, it had 19 miles on it. The car is reliable, I've never had a problem with it running. It is unbelievably peppy for such a small engine, the car climbs to speed easily on the road. Gas mileage is fantastic. It's all the hybrid mpg without the hybrid price. The only cons against it is that there is no rpm or battery gauge, and it does not handle well on turns at high speeds. The dashboard is all plastic, and while it has tons of storage room up front, my two glove compartment doors do not line up properly with the dash for whatever reason. I would recommend this car to absolutely anyone in the market for a small, hybrid-ish car. ;Sound system, the THREE glove compartments, FIVE cup holders, the seat belt alarms, and the exterior design of the car. ;toyota_yaris
10/29/2008;cabldawg;My company sent me to work about 4.5 hours away from home. I bought it for gas mileage but I was amazed at the performance of the small motor. I put a K&N filter and cruise control on it and have been very happy. ;Mine doesn't have rear window wiper and I do miss it.;toyota_yaris
10/01/2008;KWS;"I just purchased this car a week ago and first tank of gas got me over 400+ miles averaging 38mpg. Only miss cruise control of which I will probably have dealership install. I'm 6'1"" and the leg room needs a hair more for me but other than that this is a great car. ";great gas mileage;toyota_yaris
07/24/2006;Christine;I have always had larger cars with all the bells & whistles (i.e. Pontiac Bonneville SSEI, Lincoln Town Car Signature Series). Due to my long commute to work and the cost of gas, I checked out the Yaris after seeing it on the government's fuel economy website. I bought the manual transmission Yaris S Sedan the same day. My last tank of gas averaged 42.3 mpg compared to my previous vehicles 18 mpg. No bell or whistle can outweigh those numbers! I love driving it and everyone is amazed at the room inside.;Gas mileage = money in my pocket! Toyota reliability & super cute with the S package. ;toyota_yaris
07/23/2006;SFDriver;I have had my quirky black Yaris liftback for about three months now, and I couldn't be happier. The first couple tanks of gas worried me, because I wasn't getting the mileage I expected, but since then it's been great, between 32 and 40 mpg depending on the mix of driving I'm doing at any given time. I love the styling inside and especially out. Even for an hour-long commute, which I sometimes have to do, the ride is quite comfortable for such a small car. The seats are perfectly comfortable for me. The steering and acceleration are very responsive, which make it fun to drive, not what I expected for such an economical price.;Cute styling, gas mileage, aux audio jack.;toyota_yaris
07/22/2006;John;I drive about 120 miles a day and I am getting 44 mpg on the highway. Blended city/hway I'm getting 38... If you drive hard you will get a bit less but doing 70 and hold back on the jack rabbit starts and you should get the same. I have the automatic and the performance is fine. It's not the fastest car, but there is plenty of power to hang out and pass on the highway. Overall the car is great, it runs great, rides great, just a great price performers.;Great seats, handling, gas mileage, aux jack for my iPod.;toyota_yaris
07/22/2006;bws2;This is a terrific small car that is fuel efficient and easy to handle... great for parking in snug spots. Has lots of hidden storage and is very roomy for its size. This car turns heads and is fun to drive. The negative to this car is the engine runs loud, especially at about 45-60 mph ~ but then at higher or lower speeds it has a nice comfortably low engine sound... it just takes getting used to. The seats are very comfortable and made to be supportive. I love the instrument panel being in the center and often wonder why it being behind the steering wheel never bothered me all those years ~ it is actually very user friendly. This is a great affordable car IF you can find one on a lot!;Hidden dash storage and lots of cup holders. The instrument panel in the center is a big plus. The fold down seats are perfect for traveling. It even provides a comfortable room for our big dogs to stretch out for the trip and still have a bit of room on the floor & back of the car for luggage!;toyota_yaris
07/18/2006;Ben;It does not have the handling and performance of the 2003 Dodge Neon that I traded in but the fuel savings are about 40 dollars a week so far. I have put about 300 miles on it this week and should average about 400 or so a week. It is a lighter car than I am used to and the only plus so far in this car is the economics. I have yet to take it on any long trips but would rather have this Yaris than the Neon when it come to gas prices. I am saving about 5 or so miles a gallon so far in the city and should save 10 on the highway. I would say that this is an average car and does what it was built to do. Save on fuel, not on style or personality.;Gas savings. Space inside for passengers and driver alike. ;toyota_yaris
07/17/2006;Michael;I fell in love with the Liftback when I test-drove it in May 2006. I ordered the 2007 Yaris Liftback automatic transmission in Blazing Blue with the All Weather and Convenience Packages. It ended up coming with an armrest and rear bumper protector too. I took almost 2 months to get here but was well worth the wait. With my first tank of gas I averaged 42 mpg (about 75% highway/25% local driving.) I find that it is zippy to drive,accelerates well to get onto highways with ease. The controls are easy to operate.The center instrument panel is no trouble.The seating is very comfortable. You sit uphigh and feel like you are in an SUV. I love my Yaris!!;Great fuel economy. smooth ride, comfortable seating. Center instrument panel is cool and not distracting. Love the CD player/ sound system. Great tight turning. Solid suspension. Great storage cubbys. Lots of back seat room and loads of room need to transport stuff with back seat folded down.;toyota_yaris
07/14/2006;Jason;I have had this car for 2 days and love it. I am 6?2? tall, and I fit in the back seat fine, I own the car of course so drive in it. The car is zippy. I call it my little Buzz Buzz. No problem in corners, acceleration is nice (I have the 5 speed manual) and I do not think the price can be beat. It is everything the Echo should have been (and could have been since it shares the platform with the Echo and the Scion xA). For weighing less than 2300 lbs, it does not feel terribly light, but I have not driven it in a wind storm yet. I commute about 30 miles a day and no problems. The interior build quality is fantastic! Not to mention I get 3 glove boxes, a little waste bin, and 5 cup holders.;Cup holders and cubbies everywhere. Very well thought out interior. Fantastic paint job. Quality for a low price. Peppy performance. 40 Miles to the gallon! Woohoo. Smooth ride and nice handling. All my friends love it. The Price. Lots of room in the engine bay. Solid braking. Cargo space.;toyota_yaris
07/13/2006;Mcorbin;This car is dynamite! I was looking for a reliable, fuel efficient car and I got it! Driving secondary roads in VT I average between 39-41.3 mpg! You can't beat that. Exceptionally roomy inside. I expect it to serve me for many years in the future. ;The fuel efficiency!!! It's presence on the road - super smooth & quiet during all driving conditions.;toyota_yaris
07/10/2006;cmoua06;I've had the car for a month now. I love the fuel economy of it. I do hear it a little wind noise but not that much of a bother to me since it is an economy car. It's much better than my 01 civic that I traded it in for. Its stylish, comfortable and roomier than I thought it would be. ;The speedometer and the interior of the car. ;toyota_yaris
07/10/2006;Clare F;My old car died, suddenly, so I had to buy a car quickly. I did not think I could afford a new one, but saw the Toyota Yaris. Wow, this car is HOT! I called many dealerships to find one, as soon as these cars arrive on the lot they are sold and I can see why. This car gets unbelievable gas mileage. The first tank full I got 40.2mpg the second tank full 41mpg and I don't live anywhere near a highway. It is a fun car to drive, quite zippy, but obviously lacks power on the big hills. It is comfortable to drive and has nice seats. I am delighted with it. I can't believe the price of it, rich or poor, this is a great car to buy and drive!;The gas mileage per gallon of course! I do like the position of the odometer and speedometer. Gives the driver a feeling of having more room.;toyota_yaris
07/06/2006;Cheap Thrills;"Small on the outside, roomy on the inside. Material quality and fit are very good. Performance is surprising for a 108 HP engine. Brakes and handling are excellent. Fuel mileage in heavy rush hour traffic and steep hills is averaging 37 MPG. Fits four full-sized adults with comfort. Easy to get in and out of. Seating position is elevated with unobstructed view. Toyota has done their homework well and has produced a solid economy car with a styling edge. Add 17"" sport wheels,a spoiler and some sport trim pieces and the car will definitely turn heads.";Fuel economy, handling, solid feel, build quality.;toyota_yaris
07/02/2006;Pippin;The Yaris has far exceeded my expectations after reading lackluster reviews. It is as quiet as my wife's Mercedes on the highway, with far better gas mileage. It doesn't feel cramped at all. The stereo is decent, not great, but it's all in the speakers which are easily changed. I have the pwr pkg, which has upgraded trim, well worth it. Auto has very smooth operation, and the electric steering is buttery. Very solid on hwy, no small car feel. When I walk to the garage and have the option of the Mercedes E320 or the Yaris - it's always the Yaris for me. FYI - the dash lightup at night is very, very nice. The center gauges mean no reflection on the windshield in front of you at night.;Camry-esque styling in front, Avalon-esque rear. Gauge styling is nice, better than anything in class or slightly above class (pwr pkg with tach).mp3 player integration.Very nice paint job. Single dashboard with no cutout for passenger airbag.;toyota_yaris
06/29/2006;Portia;It's the most fun car to drive and the fuel economy is amazing. I gave it a 9 in comfort because power locks and windows should be standard. This is my first Toyota, and I will buy another when this commuter, is done. I drive an average of 30K a year, and it was my parents, Toyota Camry with 340K miles that made my decision to look at the Yaris.;The AM&FM, CD with auto level sound was a feature that I thought was only for luxury cars.;toyota_yaris
06/29/2006;Toyota4ever;"When I first saw this car, I figured there was no way my 6'2"" son was gonna fit in it. Not only does he fit comfortably, but he has more room in the Yaris than in my Prius. This is a great car for a college kid: inexpensive, fuel efficient, and not big enough to haul his buddies everywhere. I was very impressed with the quality of this car. Unlike most compacts, it has doors with the depth of most full- size cars. When I was in college I owned a 1982 Toyota Tercel. This car reminds me a lot of that vehicle. With gas prices only going up, this car made too much sense for me to pass up when choosing a car for my son.";GAS MILEAGE !!! Quality construction. Unique styling. Interior room;toyota_yaris
06/27/2006;Moose;I drove the Yaris out of pure curiosity, and ended up buying one an hour later. The smooth, quiet ride and zippy acceleration are unlike any other compact car I've ever driven. I was worried about handling with it's rear torsion bar suspension, but it handles like a sports car - I've already had a fun day in the mountains with it. I drive 100 miles a day, and the fuel economy (38mpg so far) is saving me $80-100 a week on gas versus my old truck. I recommend this car to anyone - it surpasses any and all expectations - even for a Toyota!;"Super quiet, smooth ride, ""cute"" exterior, ergonomic interior, quick acceleration, FUEL MILEAGE!!!";toyota_yaris
06/27/2006;Lauren;I bought one for my daughter in college. I liked it so much I bought another one for my daughter in high school. The combination of the low cost, fuel efficiency, design, build quality, and Toyota reliability made this choice a no brainer. ;I like the space inside. The handling and brakes are also great. It seems to have built better quality than a Mercedes. You can tell when you close the doors. For a ~$13k car that is saying a lot.;toyota_yaris
06/23/2006;kris roop;This is the first Toyota that I've purchased. It's a great car all the way around. Gas mileage is wonderful, lots of extras! Peppier than I thought it would be for a 1.5 liter 4 cylinder. Neat interior design as well as the front end. A lot more attractive than the corolla! I will definitely purchase another vehicle from toyota.;The interior design with the speedometer in the middle. I love the look of the front end along with of course, the gas mileage. Large trunk for the size of the car.;toyota_yaris
06/22/2006;Florence Hanlon;"I absolutely love my new Yaris. It has given me great mileage, actually going more than the promised 39mpg, closer to 41 or 42. I have had it about a month to the day, and have only had to fill it up twice, have put more than 400 miles on it. I would like to know however if the safety tests have been done yet on it. I bought it because I had such good success with my first car, a Toyota Celica, and so I trust Toyota, and so far, have found nothing to complain about. I especially like that the ""hump"" in the dashboard is in the middle, rather than on the drivers side, obstructing my view. Would still like to know safety rating.";I like the fact that I can reach the gas and brake pedals without having to move the seat so far up that I can't turn the steering wheel easily.;toyota_yaris
06/22/2006;rodnreel;Fun to drive, good on gas, the doors slam like a big car. :-) What more could you want?;The driver's side glove box!;toyota_yaris
06/22/2006;Mark Markgraf;I have only had the car for a about a month... but I'm completely happy. It's very gas efficient, gets alot of looks from passerbys. Has a peppy engine. And it's actually fun to drive. I love this car. ;Interior, fuel efficiency, dash board.;toyota_yaris
06/20/2006;Nihilist;"I had been holding off purchasing a car until the arrival of the Smart, ""For Two"" into the US. No longer. I ordered my hatchback last month and it showed up yesterday. Fun is the best way to describe it. Clean, simple interior and cute exterior. The hatch is not a family car, but for me and my wife it's perfect.";Interior design and driver and passenger spaciousness. Smooth ride. Overall looks.;toyota_yaris
06/19/2006;Sean;At first, I was taken back by how small this car is. But, when I climbed inside I was amazed at how much interior room there is. The center console is different, but once you get used to it, it's actually more convenient than peering through the steering wheel like most cars. The car corners very well and is surprisingly resistant to being blown around on the highway (for a subcompact anyway). Toyota managed to get the price down by making features optional that come standard on other cars, so expect to pay more than the base MSRP (but it's worth it). Availability is limited in 2006, so you may have to be patient if you're picky about options. Great car; would buy again! ;toyota_yaris
06/15/2006;New york city gal;So my last car was a Honda Accord. I know its not fair to judge this car based on my past vehicle but Im pretty sure that is why I'm not wholly astounded. I find this car to be quite bumpy on the road (as expected from such a small lightweight car), & I truly hate the brakes. I feel like the car is almost out of control when braking. When driving on a bumpy road I feel like I'm riding a bike on a cobblestone road. Maybe I'm not used to it but I've been driving it for 2 weeks already. Car sounds like a tank when accelerating, and really can't keep up with other cars. Overall, I expected better but its still not a bad car. And for the price & toyota name I really can't complain.;Exterior design. Tons of room on the inside, interior style is really cute and I like the center console. Great gas mileage and inexpensive car payments. ;toyota_yaris
06/14/2006;Eric Krakowski;The Yaris is definitely the best car I have ever purchased. I'm very happy with its handling ability and fuel economy (especially the fuel economy). The gas meter doesn't even move when your driving on the highway, and the ride is soooo smooth for a little 4 cylinder car. I highly recommend this car for anyone who doesn't care about muscle, but cares about economy and class. I'm very proud to own a Yaris.;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
06/12/2006;cosado;My other vehicle is a Land Cruiser and this is the perfect complement to it. I am constantly thinking of reasons to run errands so that I can drive it. I ordered the liftback without even driving it because of it's looks and my confidence in Toyota build quality and it didn't disappoint. I've driven almost 350 miles and I'm still waiting for the gas meter to reach the bottom bar. A very nimble car with good power, whether I'm alone or with my wife and kids. By the way, the Yaris was a hugh success with my 8 and 9 year old kids! ;Comfortable seating. Unbelievably roomy interior. Tight, nimble handling. Fuel economy. Adjustable rear seat. Mp3 jack for stereo. Everything within easy reach in the engine compartment. All the attention when I drive it!;toyota_yaris
06/03/2006;Will;Saw the commercials. Test drove it and LOVED it! This car is serious value, serious quality, and serious FUN!;Custom Molded water-bottle holders in the door, AUX port for iPod standard, awesome automatic engine assistance when you are going down a hill.;toyota_yaris
05/29/2006;Jeff;I have only owned Toyotas, from including a Previa, Corolla, Rav4 and 2003 4Runner. This is a great little commuting car. I have a 30+ mile commute each way, and should save 15 MPG compared to my Rav4... which alone should save me almost my car payment. Surprisingly roomy, feels much bigger than the Corolla. We have 2 small kids in car seats and this car will allow us to take the Yaris instead of the 4Runner around town. I haven't found a complaint yet with it... The Corolla in its current form is in trouble. This car is $3000 cheaper than a Corolla, feels bigger and is a heck of a lot better to look at.;"Everything... the car looks great for an ""entry-level"" car, and is much larger than the price tag implies.";toyota_yaris
05/28/2006;Mailman37204;I love this car already. The gas mileage has been excellent so far (38 mpg), and it's a real head turner in traffic. There are a few things that take some getting used to, including the center-mounted display, but after about 2 days I began to wonder why all cars don't have it. For a pretty small car, the Yaris sure does have plenty of leg room. It will whip in and out of traffic in the city, and when you take it out on the interstate, it will absolutely fly down the road with suprising comfort. Overall very fun to drive, good looking, and a smart move considering the price of gas these days.;Great gas mileage. Comfortable Ride. Front end looks awesome. Low Price. Toyota Reliability.;toyota_yaris
05/27/2006;w0lfgh0st;I needed to replace my Echo and this is the perfect car for anyone. It's surprisingly sporty in the manual and is far more comfortable than it looks like it would be. I couldn't be happier! Plus, it's a Toyota, so you know you're getting something good!;What's not to love;toyota_yaris
05/25/2006;Elsie;I'm so glad I decided to buy a new car and not a used one. The car is super nice and comfortable. I personally believe its a young woman's car. The experience of driving and owning this vehicle has been great. All my rides are smooth and comfortable... totally recommend it.;The Yaris is amazing with gas I can travel non-stop for over 5-6 hour and still be good on gas. I've never seen anything like this before. With gas prices going up these days I believe this is a great feature to have.;toyota_yaris
05/25/2006;jsmale;"Dubbed ""The Yar-mobile"" by co-workers, everyone including myself is surprised by the amount of room in this hatchback. Going from a Ford Explorer to the Yaris I feel quite comfortable, however my hauling days are over. After my first fillup I get 35.2 MPG city only driving. This car has met all my expectations! I couldn't imagine spending less than $20K (CAD) and getting more bang for the buck in any other vehicle. This is my first Toyota and I am very impressed.";Very comfortable, great handling around corners. Love the large cup holders. Nice interior trim. Good acceleration. Lots of storage compartments. Very easy to get used to the centre console.;toyota_yaris
05/23/2006;Iz;Just bought a Yaris as a commuter car and just love it. Comfortable, even for those with long legs, and really zippy. Handling a long, hilly commute at highway speeds without any trouble. Already enjoying the great gas mileage and my reduced expenses!;Sits relatively high for a small car - don't feel like you're riding 2 inches off the ground. Love my keyless entry on the ignition key - only one thing to attach to the keyring instead of a remote as well.;toyota_yaris
05/20/2006;luvmyyaris;I have to say that I love my Yaris. It is sharp and economical. The gas mileage is good and the car has been very reliable thus far. Very reasonable price.;The power package and safety features were a big draw.;toyota_yaris
05/17/2006;Jewell;I bought a 2007 Toyota Yaris 4 days ago and could not be happier- the money I'm saving on gas is fantastic. The MP3 jack is huuuge for me. The seat is comfy and the car is quite stylish for an economic vehicle. I would recommend this to anyone. ;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
05/13/2006;Andy;Overall I really like my new purchase of the Toyota Yaris. The interior could have a few more features, like a temperature gauge and other normal stats. Its small compared to the average American vehicle, which makes it extremely easy to parallel park in smaller spots and to maneuver around things. It'd be nice to have some faster acceleration, but I guess thats just a trade-off for a car with good gas mileage. ;Gas mileage, newer design, the console supports CDRW and MP3 discs, and also has an input for MP3 players. ;toyota_yaris
05/13/2006;Doodoo;This car replaces the Echo, which was a good car, just ugly. Now since the ugly is gone it's perfect. My new Yaris is beautiful. The short shifter lets me sap up as much as the little 1.5 engine can be expected to provide. I get over 10 miles more than the Kia Rio per gallon out of the Yaris I feel good about saying that this is probably the best little car ever made. ;Center console (seems weird, but great for view and night vision. I like it), Nice factory radio with 6x9's in the back. Short shifter. Fold down rear seats. Perfectly placed cupholders. Can't help but smile when you see it. Oh, and the gas mileage is something to smile about;toyota_yaris
05/12/2006;batman;So far this car is adding up to the reason why I bought it - great gas mileage. I am constantly told how classy this car is. It is pretty roomy inside and the dash is great. So far I am averaging between 30-34 mpg. The only criticism I have is the compartments or lack of near the driver side. They are hard and even impossible to reach when standing still let alone driving. Overall so far a great car that drives nice on the highway.;Dash, speedometer, stereo system;toyota_yaris
05/11/2006;Lou &amp; Sue;We now have 600+ miles on our loaded liftback. Both wife and I are impressed with it's comfort, handling and design. We have mostly stick-shift cars over last 35 yrs, including 3 ALFAS & a Ford Fiesta. This car is similar to the Fiesta, and gets thru the turns as good as the Alfas, maybe better. Have not pushed the engine or brakes yet, but appears they will do quite well. Only 1/2 way thru 2nd tank of gas;toyota_yaris
05/10/2006;Rick S;This car is a great little car! We sold her 2004 Prius to get this one. She was not getting to take advantage of the gas mileage on the Prius for the payment we were paying. So I sold it on ebay for $3000 more than we owed and bought the Yaris. What a deal. The payment was half and the mileage is about the same as she was getting. And the insurance is less. Plus, in 48 months the car will be paid for, just in time for our youngest to take it to college! The oldest get my Prius. lol The Yaris is very fun to drive I like to drive it when I get the chance. ;I like the looks, the feel and the little port where you can plug in the mp3 player or our xm radio.;toyota_yaris
05/10/2006;linda jonke;"We have several cars, a newer Corvette & a 05 Jeep. With the gas prices & my husbands long comute we went looking for a more economical car. This is the perfect car. At 6'2"" and 215 my husband is not a small guy, he loves this car! At first everyone teased him at work, now everyone one wants one. He loves the power, the solidness & everyone knocks on our door at home & wants to know what it is! My husband wears a suit to work. The other day, 5 large guys in suits paged him to the parking lot & were sitting in the car just to prove you could fit car! He loves open window air & this is the first car he has owned that he can open the window and there is no noise or wind. Toyota has a winner. ";Size and speed;toyota_yaris
05/09/2006;James;I drive about 700 miles per week (practically all interstate), so I am loving the fuel economy. I went from an American mid-size car to this and really do not notice much difference in the comfort level. I have had this car about 3 weeks now and am getting around 35-37 mpg so far. That is enough savings to make 1/2 the payment!;Seat comfort and head/leg room.;toyota_yaris
05/08/2006;keggo;My wife just sold her standard cab Tacoma and after a couple weeks of searching for a Scion tC, we decided to look at the Yaris. I WAS a little hesitant as it was fairly small looking. When we got there to see it and test drove it, we knew we wanted it. It's a great car that gets GREAT gas mileage, is fun to drive, and feels really solid. I could only go up to 10 on the rating, but if I could, I'd go well above that. Great car, great price, great mileage!!!;Center mount gauges. Smooth manual tranny. Good stock sound system. Is way bigger inside than it seems from the exterior. Good passenger:cargo space ratio.;toyota_yaris
05/07/2006;Efficient;This car has everything one would desire. The build quality is equal to cars costing $30,000+. I have had it for 3 days and the gas gauge has not moved after 100 miles of driving. This car is the answer to all the price manipulations by the oil industry. With this car you do not have to give up comfort and good acceleration. The build quality is similar to a Camry. I highly recommend this vehicle. ;Roomy interior;toyota_yaris
05/06/2006;Chris;What a great little car, I have driven a hyundai accent hatchback since 2002 and this is soo much nicer, it is more comfortable, the mileage is better, it looks a whole lot cooler, the only thing that this doesn't have is all of the standard features, but overall I have no complaints.;How high the seating is in this car compared to others, you don't feel like you are driving a small car.;toyota_yaris
05/06/2006;sully;"Turns on a dime. Better gas mileage than window sticker states. Great transmision, holds its own going up hill,and down as well.

Kids have plenty of room. Awesome interior set up.";Tranny mileage stereo looks;toyota_yaris
05/05/2006;michael;A very good car. I'm 6'3'' and fit comfortably but snugly into the car. The principle options I wanted were the convenience package, antilock brakes, and side impact airbags. I found they are not building any Yaris sedans with side impact airbags because it would raise the cost and make it uncompetative with rivals. I would have paid the $1000 extra.;Reliability, fuel economy, quality materials, reasonable performance;toyota_yaris
05/03/2006;Meredith;i recently purchased my '07 yaris hatchback and i LOVE IT! it is extremely spacious on the inside and i love all of the available features, the armrest(very comfortable), the aux jack which is even better because it is accesible with i-pods, keyless entry, power windows, etc.. this car is a dream. Lots of pickup, this car really likes to go even though it only has 109 hp. The digital gauges are a fun new feature that i havent yet seen in a toyota(my family owns only toyotas).;body style, stereo, digital gauges, interior space, hatchback, great gas mileage!!!;toyota_yaris
05/02/2006;brighterdeath;"First, I'm not a fan of the sedan, it is rather ordinary while the 3 door liftback is anything but. This is a great car! It's built beautifully. I'm 6 foot 4 and have plenty of room, as much or more than most larger cars. It is an optical illusion, small on the outside, big on the inside. The center gauges make me wonder why they haven't been there standard for years, now the speed easily comes into my line of view as I am scanning for traffic, rather than having to avert my eyes and see through the steering wheel. The car stops, steers and just in general, feels very good. I have a hard time referring to it as an economy car, it is cheap to run but there is nothing ""cheap"" about it.";It's build quality and the fact it is a small car that dosen't feel like a small car. It's uniqueness.;toyota_yaris
04/28/2006;Mike;I bought this so I could put my bike in the back which I can with no problem. I can also put in a diswasher in the box that I picked up at Sears. A large dog crate also fits in the back without a problem. If you have long legs you might be a bit cramped.;Great gas mileage. 39 on the highway and 36-37 around town.;toyota_yaris

04/26/2006;Liz;I've always had small American cars. I was tired of throwing money away after 60K. Everyone I know that has a Toyota, loves it. I thought it was about time I owned one. I love my mother's Rav4 but it was too pricy for my budget.

04/26/2006;arie;The 07 Yaris was initially puchased as a fuel conserving alternative to my BMW. Now, I only drive the yaris. It is a pocket-rocket.

The gas mileage is amazing. the car is perfect and fun to drive. goodbye gas guzzlers! I am hooked on the yaris!;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
04/26/2006;mike;I bought the Yaris because since I wanted Toyota quality and fuel efficiency. It seems to work well and has good performance. I drove the 07 Camry CE manual and did not notice a significant difference from the Yaris manual sedan. I believe it's the power/weight ratio... which is approximately the same. A little pricy compared to Korean competitors... I would have paid extra for the side impact airbags and antilock brakes but was told they may never ship the side impact airbags... if so for at least 5 months.;I bought this as an inexpensive commuter car... so the price and mileage were most important. I am also pleased with the many small but important features... many cupholders... rear arm rest... big trunk;toyota_yaris
04/24/2006;Sarai Graterol;The driving has been great and the experience has been good, the only thing I feel not right is that in order to have basic features like power lock and power windows, I needed to pay extra, it is not included and in today's world those feature are a must!;My favorite future is the CD stereo and the auxiliary input jack. I also like the speed meter in the middle, I feel is better visually when I am driving. ;toyota_yaris
04/23/2006;sjb5001;I traded in my Echo for a Yaris and I am blown away by how luxurious this entry level car feels. Even with 2 hp less than the Echo, the Yaris feels like a Corolla and has no problem accelerating and keeping up with traffic. The new suspension and electric steering makes handling feel more like a European car than Japanese. It also has a very quiet ride on the highway and is comfortable for long trips. And for those weary about the cupholders being up near the vents, don't worry, it holds drinks very tightly. They also make a good spot for your cellphone. I hope to have this car until the day it dies, which will be a long, long time.;Interior and exterior style (especially the gauges), quietness and comfort, dual overhead lights, fuel economy, the fact that the interior was designed more for the driver, Toyota reliability.;toyota_yaris
04/22/2006;janet13669;I've had this about a week and i just love it. It's so quiet and smooth to drive. The gas mileage is supposed to be 40 mpg- but I have gotten more than 40. It's so small I can park it almost anywhere and its zippy as hell.;"The seats are so comfortable and have that ""minivan"" kind of elevated feel. And oh yes- the gas mileage!";toyota_yaris
04/21/2006;Batavia;So far, so good. Owned for a week and a half and have put on a whopping 200 miles. It appears gas mileage will be a big plus, along with the hoot that we get driving this cute little booger;Interior room;toyota_yaris
04/18/2006;AJ;I get pulled aside in parking lots and asked a lot about this car. It's sharp looking for a mini, much more affordable than the M-cooper, and get almost 40mpg. Peppy acceleration, great on turns. ;It looks so cool (ok, cute) and is great on gas.;toyota_yaris
04/15/2006;Candice;I love my Yaris. It looks like a small Corolla. It handles well and has that extra power that you need for the freeway. I am getting 350-400 miles per tank, WOW!!;Exterior- the look from the front interior- gas milage and cup holders;toyota_yaris

04/11/2006;Cincy2;I picked up a metallic blue hatchback this weekend. Toyota's quality and this vehicle's gas mileage (39 hwy) were what attracted me to this model. I was shocked to find I actually enjoyed driving it! I know vehicle quality. My other cars are a MB CL500 and Lexus Rx300. This little car is well made, peppy and has a lot of character. Highly recommended. ;Lots of accessories to customize it.;toyota_yaris
04/10/2006;tezra;I have only had it a day, but I live 25 miles from the closest city and going back home is all up hill. I didn't have the least bit of problem climbing the hill. I am suppose to break it in at 70 mph. Having trouble keeping it from 80 mph, an thats going up 4000 ft elevation from sea level. Handles well, radio sounds good. Gas is barely off top end of gauge, and I have driven it close to 80 miles already. It is comfortable to sit in. Plenty of leg room and head room for me at 5'6. The engine purrs. Very quiet. A little wind noise but not much. Sporty looking. ;Easy to drive, comfortable, roomy, plenty of trunk space, good on gas, the tail end sits low enough to see while backing, sporty looking, plenty of cup holders.;toyota_yaris
04/10/2006;lbstrgrl1;This car has it all... looks, performance, economy. When I showed my friends and coworkers they couldn't believe it was an economy car... sure doesn't look like one. Great purchase all around. ;I love the 60/40 fold down rear seats, big trunk, engine has easy access for maintanence. Great stereo with MP3 compatibility. ;toyota_yaris
04/07/2006;gwscheil;Actual mileage in the first three tanks is 31-36 mpg under less than ideal driving conditions. Comfortable to drive, controls are easy to use. It was easy to adjust to the center mounted instruments. Have not yet needed to fold down the rear seats for more cargo space on short trips, city errands and shopping. Better visibility than in the Matrix or Scion Xa. ;The computer reminders are polite and helpful. 7 hours plus of high quality mp3 on a CD (with convenience package)- no special formatting needed. No power steering noise at all from the electric assist system.;toyota_yaris
04/07/2006;lawyerchick;Just purchased my new car two days ago. So far, extremely happy with my purchase. As econo-cars go, the Yaris seems to be well thought-out and engineered. There is sufficient room for passengers and the seats are plain but supportive. There are enough bells and whistles to make it feel like a more expensive vehicle. It is stable and nimble to drive, even at highway speeds. Fuel efficiency has been absolutely fantastic.;The power package is well worth the price. I like the various storage compartments, and the trunk is quite large for such a small car. The fold- down seats are very useful.;toyota_yaris
04/05/2006;Amanda;"I have a 2007 Yaris Liftback automatic in Blazing Blue. I have only had the car about a week, but I am very pleased. It has great pick up and lots of ""zoom"". There is so much storage I don't know what to put in it. From what I can tell the back seat is pretty roomy too. (I think the doors have shrink-rays in them). The outside looks so small, but the interior is extremely spacious. Each day I am discovering more things - like the sun visor extenstions! The cd player can play mp3 cds and I still have to try out the auxillary audio jack.";"Storage, ""zoom"" factor, very comfortable, sits high so you aren't blocked too much by SUVs";toyota_yaris
04/05/2006;Edmunds Consumer;Bought this one because of absurd oil prices. Wanted a reliable smaller car that was good on gas but still had some interior room. The economy is good and I'm averaging around 30 so far. Headroom is fine. Road noise is still too intrusive. The doors need protective moldings. The dash is terrible and too far away to read properly. Why can't Toyota put the dash where it belongs? The old style 4 speed automatic sometimes is jerky and I would wish for a newer 5 speed automatic like some competitors use. Also more power would be appreciated.;Room and gas mileage, looks better than the old Echo;toyota_yaris
04/04/2006;N9QGS;After looking at the Echo and the option packages, I'm very pleased to say that I really like what the Yaris has brought, nice package options, safety curtain airbag option, gas mileage better then 36 mpg. and the car has a very nice ride longer wheel base then the echo, quiet interior for the price of the vehicle. Great commuter with toyota reliablility;Aux input with the mp3 player compartment right near the jack. nice because you dont have a cord stretching around the car like on the scion.;toyota_yaris
03/28/2006;Juljeep;I just purchased this vehicle on the 23rd of March, so my review is based on only 500 miles of usage. This vehicle is an excellent price, it handles corners very well, it has enough get-up-and-go on the highways that I have to be careful, it is extremely well-designed. I'm a large person (6'3'', 260 lbs.) and I have no shortage of space. I took my parents and wife for a drive and no one was cramped. The back seat has an unusual amount of room. I have plenty of head and leg room, and if you need to, the back seat folds flat for a good amount of cargo space. And at 40 mpg, who can complain. I'm saving enough to cover my car payment!;"I am stoked about the gas mileage and the trusted Toyota longevity. My wife's favorite features: the cuteness factor and the comfort. She recommends ""Bayou Blue"" in color.";toyota_yaris
03/28/2006;joanne;This car was built for me. I love it. It handles well and go when I need it. My hubby call it the jigger bug because of it size but inside it not so small. It handles well and rides like a dream. Would I buy a second one you betcha.;How the inside feels. It does not have the small car feel. I do not feel trapped in a tin can. ;toyota_yaris
03/26/2006;PINNACLE; Picked up a Yaris 3 door hatchback yesterday. It is one of the first ones on the road in NJ. I have owned two Toyota Echos and I can say that this is a much better car that sold for about the same price as the 2000 Echo. Quality paint, interior, ride and handling. This Yaris has a automatic trans. ; A good looking quality car. It has the same engine as my echo and I am sure it will hit 200,000 miles if you take care of it. A big improvement over the Echo. A lot of car for the money. Rated at 34 city and 39 highway. My echos get on the high end or better on the gas mileage with the same engine. ;toyota_yaris
09/23/2008;Steve;I purchased this vehicle new in May, 2006. I have received mixed reviews from friends and family regarding the looks and size of the car, but my intention was to purchase a car that was good on gas with the reliability of a Toyota. I average approximately 36 miles per gallon, mostly freeway with some in town. I am 6 feet tall and have plenty of leg and head room. Anyone sitting behind me is cramped. My complaint, is the positioning of the steering wheel. Because I have to have the seat all the way back, the steering wheel is too far away and I find myself constantly shifting steering hands because of the discomfort. Would be nice if the wheel telescoped. Truly annoying!;Gas mileage is great, although not as much as I expected, even with me being a conservative driver. ;toyota_yaris
09/17/2008;Jim;I bought my Yaris when I retired and I'm getting 40.7 mpg without fail. I've checked it 3 times now and every time it comes out the exact same on the same 230 mile trip. With the fuel tank at 13 gal plus I can get over 400 miles per tank of regular gas. I LOVE IT!;Gas mileage, power, ease of handling.;toyota_yaris
09/15/2008;Monika;"I bought my Yaris 2 years ago, I was probably one of the first customers. Everyone kept asking me questions about my car, people rolled their windows to ask me about my car. And after 2 years I have not had a problem, in fact I love it more, as it is reliable and very comfortable! I drive about 90 miles per day, and school at least 2 times a week, so as you can see I spend a lot of time in my car! I definitively recommend this car for everyone! it is known as the ""green car"" in Europe. In our last trip I was very pleased to see my car in every corner at least 5 different countries in Europe! Honestly, I can not wait for the 09 as my husband is getting one, good bye trucks! I really love it!";One of the best features is the interior space, I have gone on trips with 4 people, and no complains! it is very comfortable. You also can move many things around without problems! It is really useful in every sense;toyota_yaris
09/05/2008;yaris fan;I bought a new Yaris 4 door auto sedan and love it. I have a 2002 Toyota Tundra but the gas mileage was not that great. I wanted a car for a commute to work and found it to be fun to drive. Now I do not want to drive the Tundra any more than I have to as I get almost 3 times the mileage with the Yaris. I have not had any trouble with the car and it runs great.;"I am 6'2"" and the room inside is more than I thought a small car could have. Very comfortable for me.";toyota_yaris
09/05/2008;Phillip;I originally owned the Toyota Echo, which was truly the best car I ever owned. But I was hit by a red light runner and the car was totaled, I as well as the police and wrecker driver were amazed at the interior compartment, it had no damage at all but the front of the car was completely destroyed. So after that experience with the Echo , I went out and bought the new replacement for the Echo , which was a 2007 Yaris Sedan. The car is basic , because it was bought for my long 94 mile commute to work, but the car has quickly become my wifes favorite car, she always leaves behind her 7 passenger fully loaded SUV to drive my basic 5-speed Yaris, which she absolutely love. We love this car !;We have 3 kids which means 2 boosters and a large car seat, and we all 5 fit in the car, it also has a very large trunk. The car gets consistent 40 mpg , which is not nearly as good as the Echo but is still excellent. Dependability .;toyota_yaris
09/03/2008;Tommy;I have been driving my 2007 Yaris for 2 years. I bought the vehicle for mileage and I get 38 to 40 MPG without an exception. I drive 50 miles round trip daily. I will soon be driving 90 miles a day round trip and look forward to the gas mileage and savings. I have actually gotten 42 MPG on road trips. I bought this vehicle after my stepson purchased his Yaris. I was told it would take 4 weeks to get the vehicle, but the dealer had one in 3 days. I think this is a great car for commuting, but I will take my F250 truck when I am going on a long trip. ;The only reason I bought and I am still driving the Yaris is for gas mileage.;toyota_yaris
09/01/2008;gotta luv it;"Surprisingly roomy inside. Fits a 6'1"" 365 lb. person. Love the gas mileage. We drive it everywhere. So much fun to drive too. Doesn't do bad in the winter either. The only thing is there is road noise. But, it is an economical car not a full size one. We love it. We would definitely recommend it.";Center dash where all the instruments are.;toyota_yaris
08/28/2008;No Regrets;I purchased my Yaris liftback about 2 years ago, and it's the first car that never gave me buyer's remorse. I've owned luxury cars, 4x4s, station wagons, sedans, and sports cars. Every one of them forced me to compromise. I'm in a band, and I can fit a Marshall half-stack, 2 JBL monitor cabs, 4 guitars, a bag of cords, a change of clothes, and my girlfriend in my Yaris. Usually, five can ride comfortably. It's so good on gas, I sometimes forget which side the gas cap's on. This car is the perfect blend of economy, utility, and style. Complete strangers are so fascinated by it, they strike up conversations with me in parking lots. With rising fuel costs, this car is the way to go. ;Fuel economy, go-kart handling, incredible cargo/passenger capacity for its size. It has 3 glove boxes, iPod jack, and more cubbies and cupholders than I know what to do with. Although the center-mounted controls and gauges took me a couple weeks to get used to, I haven't had any disappointments. ;toyota_yaris
08/26/2008;Marian;I've had my 2007 Yaris for a year, and I love it. My drive to work is 65 miles round trip per day, so I really needed a fuel efficient car, and this is the perfect fit! Initially I was drawn to the car because it was cute and small and reminded me of the SmartCar, however I was pleasantly surprised by all of the perks! I've been stopped on multiple occasions by strangers intrigued by the car & can do nothing but brag about it. The backseat leg room is unbelievable, the amount of storage (including all 3 glove boxes) is amazing, & the gas mileage is wonderful. My only complaint is how sensitive the car is to wind on the highway. I love the car! ;The room, the storage, the size, the gas, EVERYTHING!;toyota_yaris
08/24/2008;josie;I love my Yaris, I'm hoping a 2009 or 2010 is coming out, because I would like to get another one.The front seats needs more padding, because on long drives it gets uncomfortable. I love the power it has to get out in traffic, and the gas mileage. It is sporty and peppy i have had people to stop and ask me about my Yaris. I also like that it holds its value very well. I traded my Echo to this Yaris. I liked the Echo's placement of the speedometer better where it was turn towards the driver, but I do love it in the center of the dash instead over the steering column. I'm short, so I've always had trouble trying to see the road because of speedometer being over the steering column. ; Love the great gas mileage, sporty, stylish, really love the speedometer in the center of the dash. ;toyota_yaris
08/23/2008;JPR;The Toyota Yaris had turned out to be the best car that I have ever purchased. My wife was hesitant at first however she now thinks it is a great car. The mileage is hard to beat. It now has over 30k miles and if it is driven right, I can reach 44 mpg on 1 tank of gas. ;My favorite features consist of the stereo, strong fan, easy to us cruise and the adjustable drivers seat ++ MPG;toyota_yaris
08/22/2008;Jamielyn6705;I bought my car last may in 2007. I saw it on line and just new I had to have it, its a fun car to drive and very reliable. The gas is great! The only bad thing I would have to say about the car is that it doesn't have great pick up, but you have to expect that because it a four cylinder. Over all excellent car!;Big trunk, great gas miles, very cute look.;toyota_yaris
08/08/2008;bill;The Yaris has been an excellent purchase from the start. 38 mpg in town using the air, 42 on the hwy. Fast and comfortable, it is a great value for the money. ;Comfortable seats, exterior design is a vast improvement over the Echo. ;toyota_yaris
08/03/2008;Scott;I got mine two years ago and I am proud of having driven it around, particularly nowadays when gas price is above $4 per gallon. It always gives me more than 38 mpg even when I drive it in town. I can say that of many cars I have driven in the past including Honda Accord and Civic, the Yaris is the only car I have been totally satisfied with in every aspect. Since it is so cute, my wife who drives a Honda Accord begs me to drive hers and her to drive mine. Last year I purchase another Yaris for my son.;Great gas mileage, fun to drive, comfy and roomy. And great look. ;toyota_yaris
08/01/2008;OKJoe;Pros: mileage still great at 37mph highway though I lost 2-3 mph when ethanol is added. Easy to park, and get in/out of. Adequate storage. A/C excellent. Dash layout excellent. Cons: seats are uncomfortable for long haul. Door arm rests are VERY hard! Also no standard middle console arm rest. Repairs: Rear view mirror disengaged from window. Cruise control disengaged two times for unknown reasons. Overall: We both still love the car and would buy again. ;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
07/23/2008;luckylady23;I bought this car new in Sept of 07 and it was the best decision I could have made. Not only is it very reasonably priced, but you can't beat the gas mileage. I average 38-city and 43-hwy. It rides very smooth, easily gets up to highway speeds, there is a ton of room on the inside, big trunk and good sound system. Not to mention, you get Toyota excellent reliability. I'm pretty sure the body will fall off before the engine dies!! I'd say this is one of the best car you can buy right now!;The interior design, I love the speedometer and stuff in the middle. Seats are comfortable. I also like the color options. You have to get the power locks and windows (why do they even offer manual?).;toyota_yaris
07/21/2008;Melissa;"I purchased this car to get me from school and work to home. I've been driving a lot and my new Durango was killing me. This is a 3rd car for my family and I wasn't sure I'd like driving a car again, but I love it. I haven't driven the truck since I got it! I bought this car used, but it only had 17,000 miles and was clean. It is so fun and comfortable to drive. Peppy, handles well, rides pretty good on the freeway doing 80mph. My husband is 6'3"" and fits well and my daughter sits behind him with plenty of room. I consistently get 39 mpg even going 80! Can't beat that!";Peppy and fun to drive.

I get 45 to 50 miles to the gallon with the a/c off and driven 55 mph with a 10 gallon tank you do the math its awesome.

I drive 38 kms to work one way each day and am just as comfortable as I was in my previous car, which was slightly larger. I am so thankful I went to such a fuel- efficient vehicle now that gas prices have skyrocketed. I laugh at the gas guzzlers passing me each day. I love my little car.

While there was extensive rear end damage the cabin was not breached. My wife was injured but did walk away from the scene.

07/01/2008;Hilary;I have always owned a Toyota Corolla. I found that the 2007 Yaris offered more interior room, trunk space and style then the Corolla and less exterior body. The price was also about 5 to 6 thousand dollars difference. Better gas mileage by far. I average 38 to 40 mpg in town and 40 to 45 mpg highway.

06/10/2008;Yaris Fan;After putting 300k on my 2004 Matrix with only having to replace the catalitic converter I bought the Yaris as a gas saver. I had the car for 16 months, drove to from San Francisco Bay to Oregon and back, and Arizona and back with no problems. The car is more fun to drive than my Matrix and doesn't drive like an econo box. For MPG, I always averaged in the mid 30s and better when I drove like most people do. After more than 96,000 on the car in only 16 month I had no problems, but then decided to drive under a Dodge Durango. Car was totaled but I walked away without a scratch.

06/01/2008;BCN;I purchased my Yaris last year for a number of reasons, one of the main ones being gas prices. The 4-door sedan I chose can seat 4 adults more comfortably than some larger cars I've had, and I'm averaging 44-45 mpg highway. It's a great little car for the money.

The worst part of having this car, was when it was windy. I had an issue where the wind hyper-extended the driver side door and it wouldn't close afterwards.

With an average mpg of 40+ in mixed driving, I can't understand why people don't park their SUVs and get this to drive to work. What I am saving in gas is making the payment, not to mention the lower maintenance costs. The only negative is the cup holders, which is really a minor thing. The stereo is decent, the interior is roomy, and the seats are comfortable. I'm not a small guy, but this really doesnt feel like a small car. ;Exterior design. Overall style. Its a very sharp looking car for the price. The engine and transmission have pop. Its not hard to keep up with traffic. ;toyota_yaris
04/30/2008;Aunit;The Yaris is all about cheap, reliable transportation and on that it delivers. I have seen well over 45mpg in mostly highway driving. I have had no reliability issues, all components work as advertised. The only issue I have had was that I was reversed into in a parking lot and the bumper cover cracked which may have been avoided but Toyota did not fit USDM cars with foam bumper absorbers (the parts under the cover, its essentially hollow under there). Canadian and Japanese cars have them. ;Passive rear steering under partial throttle really kills understeer and makes a seemingly dull fwd car more fun to drive. ;toyota_yaris
04/23/2008;jenny;I love this car! Mileage is great. I drive about 80 miles a day and its great. I am averaging about 45-50 miles per gallon! And with these gas prices that's super good. I like the way it drives pretty fast for a small car.;Everything being in the middle makes it different and the radio is nice. The low body kit makes it look sporty but girly at the same time. ;toyota_yaris
04/18/2008;Mel;I purchased the Yaris for my daughter attending a near by University, pay her car, gas. etc. It's a great 'first' car OR a great 'fuel' economy car. As long as you take care of the maintenance with dlr, drive easy you'll love the Yaris. It's easy to park, easy to maintain, maintenance is minimal (if you take care of it) and with rising gas prices how can you not want a great economical car. I love everything about it, I'm sure as newer models come out the Yaris will only improve and become a strong Toyota car. I love the options and yes, there are somethings that need to change or ad (cup holds not in good locations and would like keyless entry) other than that it's a great car.;Options available, great on gas, easy to drive, easy to park, great FIRSTS car or great economical car, just the right size for anyone;toyota_yaris
04/16/2008;dinhcara;"This is my first Toyota, but not my first micro vehicle. I've owned an 850 Fiat coupe, as well as a Renault 4CV. They were a blast to drive, and probably the reason that I was not intimidated by light-weight small cars. Those cars were much lighter than this one. Oh sure, it can be a little twitchy in the corners and on the hi-way when there's a big cross wind. And the engine, though very competent, is no Z-28 302. But for ""Fun to Drive"", this one is right up there. The electric power steering just feels right. It has the optional 15"" tires, just to let you know. It has a secure feeling, probably due to the long wheelbase for its size. People sit up high -- nothing claustrophobic.";Very ergonomic, that is, easy to get in and out of, see out of, use of controls;toyota_yaris
04/13/2008;Jess;This car is the perfect car for college students. It is reliable, low maintenance, affordable and has great gas mileage. I'm currently a student in college who lives four hours away from home, and I find this car to be very reliable. ;I love the comfort of the interior and the smooth drive.;toyota_yaris
04/13/2008;Moose;"I have a very long commute to work, and my truck's gas mileage was killing my wallet. I purchased the Yaris for Toyota reliability and the advertised fuel mileage. I got both - what I also got was an extremely uncomfortable, unsafe car. The ten minute test drive will not show just how uncomfortable the vehicle is, especially for taller individuals. Rent one first for an extended drive to make sure you ""fit."" Also, look at independent safety tests - the tests for the Yaris without side airbags are scary. The ride at highway speeds is extremely unstable and the vehicle is very quick to skid when braking in the rain. If safety is a concern, DO NOT BUY THE YARIS.";Fuel mileage, reliability.;toyota_yaris
03/31/2008;Lonnie Thibodeaux;Only fairly fun to drive. Dissatisfied with the way it is affected by slight wind which destabilizes the car. The steering wheel is to short and the car reguires constant redirection to maintain a straight path. As an owner of a Yaris, I would not recommend it.;Good styling, comfortable seating, very roomy for a subcompact. Great on gas.;toyota_yaris
03/22/2008;mary ann;Handles very well, quiet engine.;Ability to raise driver seat up or down and better comfort adjustments compared to earlier model.;toyota_yaris
03/21/2008;Elaine;Have been loyal Toyota person. Can't wait to get rid of this one. Had accident with frontal impact. Seatbelts did not engage. Toyota gave us the run around. Cannot continue to buy from a mfgr that will not stand behind it's product. Also have a moisture leak in the interior. Dealer has been unable to find it after 3 visits. Airbags also did not go off on impact. Police gave us an affidavit regarding defective seatbelts. I don't sue people but Toyota should be ashamed! I hope any Yaris owner will have their seatbelts checked!! It could save your life!;toyota_yaris;toyota_yaris
03/08/2008;testguy;I've had this car for almost two years now and I have been throughly impressed with it. It was my first new car and it has held up extremely well, minus a small ding (my own fault), when it is cleaned it looks like it did the day I drove it home. The interior is much larger than you would think (I'm 285 and have plenty of room, and my best friend is 365 and we fit with no issue). The only thing I have replaced so far have been the wipers.;I like the room, I like the radio and the MP3 features it has. The trunk space is nice and there are numerous cubby holes and places to store stuff. Oh and I love the cupholders that disappear into the dash. ;toyota_yaris
03/02/2008;CHCkid;I bought the Yaris a year ago after my '97 Monte Carlo broke down and decided it wasn't worth fixing. The Yaris is rather comfortable and is very easy to maneuver. It looks really small on the outside but it's actually roomy on the inside. I drive at least 30 miles a day to and from school and the gas mileage is incredible and the comfort of the seats are great. The Yaris does not perform well during wintery and icy conditions. The car heats up relatively quick during winter months. ;FUEL-EFFICIENCY! Audio system is pretty cool, the sporty look to the car's exterior, the cool cup holders to the side, and the comfort and maneuverability of the car.;toyota_yaris
02/06/2008;JP;I bought a Yaris as a commuter car. I drive over 60 miles a day and was driving a full size Chevy Silverado truck. The fuel savings over the past year and a half have been over $2000. I can get over 40MPG on the highway if I drive at 60MPH. The interior is well designed and comfortable to drive. Turning radius is awesome. MP3 jack is a great feature. The trunk also has tons of room. The car is fun to drive and quite stylish for under $15K. No need to shop around just go out and buy one. ;MPG, MP3 jack, and door panel water bottle holder.;toyota_yaris
02/04/2008;Bob;I mainly chose the Toyota Yaris for the fuel economy. I have averaged almost 60mpg on highway runs, and about 40mpg around town (much better than my other car)! The seating is comfortable and the interior is easy to keep clean (charcoal gray). It handles beautifully at higher speeds, even around corners! The newly redesigned headlight assembly allow great light dispersion, for improved visibility, especially if you add the Sylvania Ulta Star headlamps! Most oncoming traffic think I am running my high beams, yet I am not! The fuel tank capacity is 11.1 gallons, and I can squeeze 600 miles out of it! If you try it, you will buy it! Really deserves a second look!;The basic audio system sounds great, with the SRS technology! I really enjoy the height adjustment on the drivers seat. Pleanty of room in the trunk, especially if you fold down the split rear seat!;toyota_yaris
01/20/2008;Britty06;The Yaris Sport sedan is an excellent car! This is my first car, and I'm so happy with it. It drives great, and has great MPG also. And plus its very cute. The seats are very comfortable, people are always surprised on how much room there is in this car. Im so happy with my purchase. Thanks Toyota for making a great car! ;Everything. ;toyota_yaris
01/18/2008;Daniel;I love my Yaris. It has all the equipment I wanted in a new car, gets great gas mileage, it's a blast to drive and it's a freakin Toyota so I can rely on it for years and years to come. At first I was skeptical of the Yaris and never thought that I would own one. I kept thinking that I could never go back to a little car, especially coming out of a '95 Olds. sedan. But the more I complained about the gas mileage my tank of a car was getting, the more appealing the Yaris became. Not to mention the price point is just as attractive as the styling.;I was really happy that the stereo has the auxiliary port for my iPod. Also fog lamps are a really nice feature to have when you live in the country.;toyota_yaris
01/11/2008;Robert;Great car! I am a very frugal (okay, cheap) shopper who goes over everything with a fine tooth comb. This car is great. I owned a Geo Metro for 5 years and considered an Aveo. The Yaris is the best of the three with the most power performance, the most room, and the best at making me smile when I drive. IF I get rid of it before I retire, I'll looking to get another!;Love all the pockets, the adjustable back seats, the cargo space, and the FUN to drive it !;toyota_yaris
01/04/2008;ToyotaDownUnder;I was asked to look for a reliable car for my wife and found the much loved Yaris. We have the four-door hatch here in Sydney, Australia and it's heaps user friendly. It's modded with Toyota's bigger wheels and low profile tires which help the handling.The gas mileage is exceptional especially in Sydney traffic. It has all the pep you need for an engine of that size. Off in the bush however, it needs more torque. Trunk space is good and the back seat is roomy enough for two taller set people due to the lack of the drive shaft hump on the back floor. The experience has been enjoyable and we've had no dramas in Toyota country.;The trunk compartments located under the boot(trunk)panel are convenient for storing heaps of stuff. The look of the car beats out its competitors. ;toyota_yaris
01/04/2008;Estes;"Have not owned it for long but being 6'3"" and 255 lbs I am having a blast with this car. Everyone I know is used to me being in an F-250 or larger vehicle so I am getting used to being laughed at. With the mileage I am getting, which is on average 45 mpg, I use 1 gal per day round trip to work and home . Several co-workers have purchased one of their own. Now who is laughing? That's all I'm going to say about that! ";All of them.;toyota_yaris
12/19/2007;Casey;This car is just amazing. That's all there is too it. It has the pep that I wanted along with the style. Rush hour? No problem! This car can squeeze into little spaces. It also handles well on winding roads. I also have take this car off road on a 4-wheel trail in the woods somewhere in Illinois, it got muddied up and performed well. The engine has a lot of kick to it! If you want a cheap new car that is reliable, this is it! Plus the gas mileage! I get around 36 city and 42 highway. I just love the look on people's faces when a little 4-cyl zips by them. You would never expect so much spirit from such a little car. It is really worth the price!;Small, zippy, Toyota, price, quality and the ablility to handle me as a driver.;toyota_yaris
12/18/2007;woele;I went for the 2 door hatchback, manual, convenience package only. I was looking for a cheap, brand new car, and I got more than I ever thought I would. Being the most basic package, there's not a whole lot of extra safety features, but I almost feel like I don't need them. Handling is excellent;Fuel economy: though I've only gotten above the rated fuel economy once (40.06 mpg), my average so far is right around 37 mpg. I love the feeling of buying 6 gallons of gas and knowing I'm set for a couple of weeks. Surprising amount of space, especially with the seats folded down.;toyota_yaris
12/18/2007;Jeff;Excellent vehicle for the price! Great commuter car! MPG is in the mid 30s in Dallas traffic. The center instrument cluster is easy to get used to, and easy to read. The steering handles very well, and the car reacts quickly when needed, but initially takes getting used to. Braking is good, but clutch can be a little stiff in stop-go traffic. It rides very well, if somewhat noisy. Lots of room for such a small car, including great head clearance both front and back, and good trunk space. Sits high, which makes entry and exit easy, and gives the feel of a larger car. This car was an excellent buy;Responsive manual transmission, roomy, smooth ride, great fuel mileage for a non-hybrid.;toyota_yaris
12/16/2007;kevink;Yaris is exactly what you see is what you get. The power is impressive for a 1.5L 4 cyl and trans is smooth shifting. I average 33.7 mpg;Gas mileage, ease of handling in parking lots, performance for an econobox.;toyota_yaris
12/10/2007;scottytoohotty;I purchased 2 Yarises. I knew better from previously owning Toyotas that the Yaris would at least be reliable and fuel efficient, and to my surprise, refined (for a $15k car!) I've owned them for 6 months and so far no problems. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my purchases.;Turning radius, 35ft. best ever recorded. Center dash. Looks (best in class). MPG (best in class).Toyota refinement and reliability. Trunk space.;toyota_yaris
10/13/2009;Alex;Don't buy Altima with CVT if it does not have ABS. The issue occurs at speeds over 45 mph. If you slam breaks so they lockup until car comes to complete stop transmission locks up and throttle is stuck for up to a minute at a time. Nissan refused to correct this issue saying that this is intentional to protect transmission. It happened to me at intersection and I was able to duplicate this every time at will. I have traded my car and bought a new one. ;Car is fun to drive, Fuel economy is great over 27 mpg. Styling is great;nissan_altima
10/11/2009;Disappointed;The brakes in my 2007 Altima are horrible. I began hearing squeaking noises after 1500 miles. I went to the dealership 7 times with no resolution. Rotators and brake pads were replaced several times with still no resolution. It's awful that the EXPERT could not repair the braking system. I went thru arbitration and won, but they wanted me to pay them 1,600.00 to walk away from the car-are they crazy?? I could trade the car in with 0 out of pocket fees. I will never recommend Nissan to anyone. To have purchased a brand new car and then experience probs with the brakes so early on is ridiculous. Customer service was also rude and not helpful. Good riddance. Don't buy Nissan.;Push button start;nissan_altima
08/06/2009;cindy in poway;I have the altima 3.5 sl loaded. I really like my altima but it has had a lot of problems. I am in arbitration right now for Nissan to buy it back because they want to switch out engine because they can't figure out what is wrong with it. It was stuttering and not running smooth. After 30+ days in shop, they recommended total engine replacement. Starting at 18k miles, I had headlight, sun visor go out. I had to have belt and tension pulley replaced, master cylinder replaced; emergency brake light was coming on. Brake wear out fast;nissan_altima
08/05/2009;D Scott;Purchased this car used with 31,000 miles on it. Have had it for 3 months now and am really happy with the car. Great styling inside and out. Rides very smooth and no wind noise. I stand 6 foot and I am very comfortable in this car, my knees are not pressed into the dash. The only complaint I have is the stereo, the sound quality is awful. I assume it's the base stereo option. I'm thinking about upgrading the whole stereo system because of the sound quality.;Looks, ride quality, build quality.;nissan_altima
07/27/2009;lchat;I purchased my 2007 3.5 V6 CVT SL with 40K & I love it. This car was loaded w/lther, Bose, turn signals on the ext mirrors, b/u camera, Nav, XM Sat, 6 disc chngr, sunroof, bluetooth phone etc. I chose this over an 06 Acura TL. Yes, its true. I went shopping to replace my much loved 03 TL Type-S. I just could not rationalize spending 2K more & get less. This car has 270hp & rides smooooth. Its black on black. The Bose is fantastic. If you can buy an Altima that is loaded, you won't find a better value, how do they sell Maxima's next to this...? By the way I would not have bought the 4 cyl version, only 170 hp.;Engine, Bose, Interior Design, Touch Screen Navigation, Heated, dual zone climate & B/U Camera(kids love it);nissan_altima
07/22/2009;James;I bought this car brand new in 2007. I can't tell you how excited I was to get it. I had so much fun driving it and I got an endless amount of compliments about it. I don't think you get as many miles per gallon as they say you do, but it's still great on gas. The key never has to leave your pocket because there are buttons on the door, trunk, and a push start button to start the car. I got hit head on last weekend and my car is totaled. I can't tell you how miserable I am thinking about how much more I could have enjoyed my car. Just remember, for the 20 some thousand you are paying, don't expect the world, but expect so much more than you would from any other can in its class.;Keyless entry and push start The amount of power for a V4 The size - it's just right The AC and heat are excellent Safety: the seatbelt saved my life (i didn't even touch the airbag) ;nissan_altima
07/02/2009;Wills;After 2 months of searching and test driving, I ended up with an Altima SE. I drove; Camry, TL, G35x & Accord and by far the Altima was my favorite. It's sporty and has everything I wanted in a car. Please know it does drive somewhat like a sports car, so if you want a smooth ride go for the Accord or Camry. This car is the whole package, from the redesigned exterior to the dash and interior, I just really like the way it looks for a 4dr sedan. ;nissan_altima
07/01/2009;HarveyRussell;I have had Acuras for 12 years and decided to go with the new Nissan as a change and in response to high fuel prices. Tried the Honda, Nissan, Toyota and choose the Altima because of overall package for price. Aside from the recalls which I had expected given the first model year of new model, I have had a number of issues that should not have happened and have lead me to believe it is not worth the price. To top it off, I do not believe Nissan places as high a value on dealer customer service. I would not recommend Nissan cars or their services and I am trying to get my money in order to unload this car that is just not good enough.;Looks, expected fuel economy, interior features and use of new technologies.;nissan_altima
06/30/2009;THEPILGRIMS;My car has less than 30000 miles and the transmission already has to be replaced. My rotors had to be turned already and don't get a remote starter to the tune of 549.00 for this really bad car. I'm trading this thing in next week. What's it gonna be like at 40000 miles?? If I get one more recall I will scream!!;push button starter;nissan_altima
06/28/2009;ritkid;Great car for the money. I bought it brand new and it is now 2 years old. Nissan did a wonderful job of picking nice features to include and leaving others out to provide a wannabe luxury car at an economy car price. This is a very comfortable car, and performs wonderfully on the highway. I have added a K&N filter and that has given me a few extra MPG. The mileage is not as good as advertised on the sticker, but is still exceptional. I get about 32ish on the highway and 26 in town. The car handled very well in the snow. The only maintenance I have done is change the oil and clean the air filter in these first 26000 miles and I have had no problems at all. Just a great car. Highly recomended;Sleek look. HEATED SEATS!!!!! (great for Rochester winters) CVT is great on gas mileage and provides a smooth ride. Plenty of pep for a 4 cylinder. Nice leather interior. Folding rear seats really help when hauling bulky items. Cupholders that WORK and are easy to clean. Excellent storage all over.;nissan_altima
08/16/2007;Westies96;I have had many Honda Accords and a few Camrys. I traded my 2007 Accord EXL with navigation for my 2007 Altima 2.5SL and don't regret it. I never had a Nissan before, but was persuaded by a friend of mine who has had 3 Maximas with no problems. I have had the car for about a month now and have about 3200 miles on it. My gas mileage is great with a combination city/highway of 26.8 miles per gallon. My only issue was that the car drifts on the highway. I had the dealer look at it and they said that everything was okay. I asked if it could be the tires (Continental tires were installed at the factory). I replaced them with Michelin tires. I haven't had an issue since then.;Handling, style, power, comfort, looks, XM radio and navigation. I bought a 2.5SL and they replaced the original stereo with an aftermarket Pioneer stereo with nav and XM at delivery. It looks like the factory Bose with nav and a lot less money.;nissan_altima
08/11/2007;NC_Altima;In terms of looks, driving and performance for the 4-cylinder segment, this is a great car. Haven't been able to compare to the new 2008 Accord yet, which looks to be nice but not as sporty as the Altima. This car is very responsive in acceleration, braking and steering. Really fun to drive. Controls are all easy to reach and understand. Good selection of features/packages. Nice redesign in both exterior and interior. I have an S Conv package, with added leather, sunroof, fogs, spoiler, ABS, alum kickplates, splash guards and floor mats. Couldn't be happier.;CVT w/175 HP and 180 lbs/torque, and great mileage. Huge gas tank (20 gal) so less frequent fill-ups. Design, quality, driving characteristics, lights. Just about everything.;nissan_altima
08/09/2007;Jack*ss1;This is my 3rd Altima SE since 2002 and I have to say this one beats my 02 and 04 altima SEs hands down. Its faster, more stylish, more comfortable, better on gas and you can see and feel the Infiniti side of Nissan in this car. Fuel mpg is about 22 city 28 highway (note I like to drive fast). I test drove a Mazda6 v6, Honda Accord v6, Toyota Camry v6 and some Ford and Chevy cars and I must say the Altima was the best all around car in its class. ;Power, power and more power! New styling, new CVT.;nissan_altima
08/08/2007;Phil;Drove Toyota for 20 years. Seduced by sheet metal on '07 Camry, traded 2000 Avalon for 4-cyl. LE. Big mistake. We were not happy. Traded for 4-cyl. Altima w/SL pkg. You get SO much more car for the money with Nissan!! More power, seamless shifting, quicker handling, quieter, slightly better mpg, bluetooth, heated seats. Bose stereo is awesome, better leather and controls. For this model, Toyota loses in ALL categories!;Bose stereo, satellite radio, keyless entry and ignition, dual auto A/C, fun factor. Thanks, Nissan!;nissan_altima
08/07/2007;James;When I test drove the 2.5L/4 I found the vehicle nimble and quick at low speeds but requiring some time to 'wind-up' at faster speeds in order to pass/merge. The 3.5L/6 on the other hand was like a rocket that I had to keep tied down. It was almost annoying driving in the city because the bloody car just wanted to blast off! It absolutely hated stop and go traffic and red lights! The 3.5L was a noticably heavier vehicle and had a lot of brake lurch. Again, the 3.5L hated stop and go traffic but on the highway it was a dream. Too bad the car drank so much gas! I opted for the 2.5L because of this plus the $6000 less in price. No seat issues.;The exterior looks, the handling, nice options for the price.;nissan_altima
08/06/2007;Altima;I was considering the Camry and Altima. After test driving, the Altima was the hands down winner. With just over 1k I'm averging 27 mpg. The 4 cylinder has plenty of power.;Style, keyless start, gas mileage and interior dash lights.;nissan_altima
08/04/2007;&#034; THE BEST &#034;This is absolutly the best car in its class. I test drove them all and for power this is the best, for looks this is the best, and the push start button is the best. This is my first Nissan I've ever owned and I'm glad I chose it.;nissan_altima
08/03/2007;John C.;I was shopping for gas economy and yet did no want to drive a death trap or have low quality feel, Altima was it. Its been two days, I put on 269 miles & used not quite 1/2 tank of gas. I call it my 4 cylinder luxury car! While it's not a sports car it does handle well and has good power. I find the overall quality and feel to be top shelf. This is a great value and am sure the reliability will be as good as the other Nissans I've had. ;Bose, I like the way the presets can be fm, am or satellite radio without having to switch between them. The modern technology. The gas use meter, I've made a game out of keeping the meter in the higher gas saving side. It looks good too, I have teens and it meets they're approval! ;nissan_altima
08/03/2007;paul;I was all set to buy the Passat (also a lot of car for the money) and decided last minute to drive the Nissans. Drove both the Maxima and Altima and it was clear as day that I preferred the Altima, much more fun to drive for me and newer technology throughout. Slightly less luxurious than Maxima though. So far, I love this car. Pure pleasure to drive and I hate when I arrive at work and have to get out of this thing. I think it is the right combination of size, comfort, sport and economy to win the category hands down. I can say this after having driven the Passat, Accord, Camry, A4 and countless others. My second choice would have been the Passat. ;Bluetooth, steering wheel, navigation with backup camera, low, sporty exterior look, the xenon headlights.;nissan_altima
08/02/2007;gcs;I got a 2.5SL Nissan altima and it's great. Leather seats are good and comfy.;I love the performance of this 4 cylinder engine. Like the keyless entry, touch ignition and of course Bose sound system.;nissan_altima
08/01/2007;amram80;The V-6 is very strong, and the styling really turns heads. The stereo could have a little more output, but the sound quality is good. The intelligent key is very cool, but it does take some getting used too. Many in the Altima forums have complained about the gas mileage, but my first trip yielded 33 mpg with 90% highway driving. I picked the V-6 because much of my driving is in the mountains and it was actually a better deal than the I-4. I've gotten mixed comments concerning the premium fuel issue, but most who have the V-6 have run regular fuel without problems. In conclusion, I believe this is the best value on the market in a midsize sedan. Period.;General styling and strong V-6.;nissan_altima
08/01/2007;Jen R;"All I have owned before were Hondas. My husband and I were ready for a change, and I am glad I made it. The day I picked it up it was 98 degrees outside, my 4 cyl Accord was a dog with the A/C on, took the Altima home with the A/C blasting and it never skipped a beat. Love the ""no shift"" CVT. Gas mileage is right where I left off with my Accord, hoping it gets even better with more miles, and a long trip under it's belt. This is my first car that is actually ""purchased"" and am glad this is one I get to hang onto for a while.";Totally keyless system, CVT, convenience plus package is very nicely equipped, exterior styling that sets it apart from the competition.;nissan_altima

Runs fine on 87. For 20 cents per gallon more, I'll stick to the higher as recommended by Nissan.;Styling, CVT, power (270 hp), smart steering wheel, bluetooth, sirius radio.;nissan_altima
07/22/2007;John;Traded in 2004 Altima for 2007 with SL and electronics package. Recent road trip easily yielded 34-36 MPG @ 60-65 MPH with A/C. 70-75 MPH drops mileage by about 3 MPG. City MPG so far is about 22 MPG, lower than the rating but about 10% better than my 2004 Nissan with the same engine. Mileage should be even better after adequate break-in. Interior design overall is very good. Seat bottoms are a little firm. Ride is excellent, some road noise on bad surfaces but generally very low noise factor. Exterior design is an eye catcher, have received several unsolicited compliments. Integrated bluetooth phone generally works well, some trouble with voice commands but still learning.;CVT is awesome, large glove compartment, instrument lighting, ride, fuel economy.;nissan_altima
07/22/2007;Gabriel;I've considered Accord, Sonata and Camry. I'm happy I made the right decision. I had the car for 2 months so far. Very good engine power (forget the 6 cyl) and brakes. Very fun to drive. Mileage about 20/28 mpg with 1,300m so far. Roomy interior. On one hand, disappointed with some creaky plastics on the door panels and below the driver seat. On the other hand, the dashboard is very attractive and made with very good plastic quality. Nissan should use a better plastic quality for the door panels. Overall very nice car! I would recommend this car to a friend.;Definitively the keyless entry/start. Others: CVT. Steering wheel mounted audio controls. Great sporty look. ;nissan_altima
07/17/2007;KORN;The Altima fits all of my needs; fuel efficiency;nissan_altima
07/16/2007;Tom;I traded in a 2004 Mazda3, a car that I loved and have not looked back since. The Altima has it all and more! The look is so sleek and classy and the performance is awesome. I have the 3.5 SE and love the power, with the CVT its the best ride I have ever experienced. ;Push button start, intelligent key, turn signals in the outside mirrors, the overall look and power of the car, CVT, rear lights. The list could go on and on.;nissan_altima
07/15/2007;BRAD;I research all mid size sedans. Loved the infiniti G35. I think the Altima is just as good for thousands less. Thought I needed the 3.5 but the 2.5I was so impressive it was all I needed. Had the car for 1 week went on a 12 hour round trip and go 32-34 mpg driving 70 to 80 mph. Have always been a cloth person but I was glad to go with the leather. Always been a jeep person but I love this Altima. It's my first.;Love the CVT and the new styling in and out. The car rides and handles great and is very quiet. The 2.5I is all you need.;nissan_altima
07/11/2007;thanatos;Driving is excellent, can not complain. I have owned different brands it has met expectations. Would recommend.;Bluetooth, Bose stereo, ignition.;nissan_altima
07/10/2007;Mike;10s across the board. After driving the competition (Fusion, Accord, Camry), this Altima smokes them all. Best in class looks, performance and option/feature availability. The interior is comfortable yet sporty. Great lines on the exterior that does not blend in with all the other cars on the road. Performs very well and still gets around 23-24 MPG hwy/city combination driving. Drive one and you will be impressed. Very happy with our decision to purchase (as you could probably tell).;3.5 V6 is fast, Bose sound system rocks!, CVT is smooth, Xenon HID lights, Bluetooth, great looking exterior and interior, quality all around.;nissan_altima
07/09/2007;Javier;I bought the car to replace my old 2003 Sentra Spec V. After reviewing the Mazda6, Passat I decided with the Altima. Overall the car handles ok, acceleration is excellent for a 4 cylinder, and comfort is great. Since I had a Nissan before and never had a problem with the car it also helped in the decision making process. ;Love the keyless entry and start and spacious trunk.;nissan_altima
07/09/2007;Rob;I just bought this car but since I live 3 hours away from the dealership, I have had that much time behind the wheel. I traded a 2003 3.5 se for the 2.5 S. That power difference from the two are like night and day, but I saved a few thousand and am overall happy with my purchase. The new style is better than anything in it's price range. It actually looks better in person than in photos. I chose the 6 speed manual over the CVT, I drove both but the CVT did not offer that same sporty feel as the manual. Overall, if you want a greal looking reliable car in this price range - this is it. ;"I still can't believe how great this car looks. I'm sure the ""awe"" will wear off eventually, but it beats all other competitors in styling both inside and out. The 2.5 is not fast, but it never feels lost for power. ";nissan_altima
07/07/2007;John R. Poirier, Esq;I love the new car. Have had it for a week and it is every bit as fun to drive as I'd hoped. Best of all, since I sprung for the window security etching and the lojack, the discounts we got on our auto insurance makes it no more expensive to insure than what I was paying for my corolla. I haven't really pushed the engine much, but I can tell that if I did punch it, I'd be pressed back into my seat. It rides and handles very similiar to my wife's more expensive BMW 325is. In other words, it corners like it's on rails. Ride is stiff (sport suspension) but the roads here are pretty smooth, so no big deal. Steering is very precise, not mushy at all. I'd definitely recommend the car.;The fit and finish quality is excellent. The layout and handling are near perfect. The push button start is cool and never gets old - a constant reminder that I'm living in the 21st century! ;nissan_altima
07/05/2007;susan;Just a few days of ownership and have mixed feelings. Glad we went with the 4 cyl., power and handling seem fine. Traded a Murano and that car was so much heavier than the Altima along with quieter. Drove on the highway in pouring rain and one would think we were in a tin can. The interior compartments are loud with our belongings rattling around. Even the side door panels feel cheap. Haven't found my Bose system to be anything special either. I do love the keyless entry. Love the navigation, much improved from our last one. Gas is too soon to tell, hoping it gets better. Perhaps I'll enjoy it more as I get accustomed to it. ;Navigation, keyless entry, lumbar, outside features. ;nissan_altima
07/03/2007;Matt;"The 2.5S with convenience plus package gives all the ""must have"" features at a reasonable price. Great bang for the buck. The CVT engine is very smooth. Mileage is great, 28-30 mpg so far with mostly city driving, yet the car has plenty of pickup to accelerate onto the highway with ease. Keyless entry without having to take the key fob out of your pocket and push button start is great novelty feature that comes in very handy. Both front and back seats are very roomy on inside, seats are very comfortable. Could not be happier with our new Altima! ";Truly keyless. CVT. Gas mileage. Price for all the features you get. Nissan build quality.;nissan_altima
07/02/2007;glotzbpa;I bought this car instead of a 350Z. Wanted something fun to drive that was practical. The engine is every bit as strong, and the suspension is nicely tuned.;3.5 V6, wheels, push button, CVT.;nissan_altima
07/01/2007;Tropo;I did my homework looking for a manual gear sport midsize sedan that is loaded. After looking and driving everything in the $25K to $35K range, I was set on the Altima SE. It is everything that I wanted and then some. The car is everything it is set to do and then some!! ;Driving fun, manual gear, road handling and acceleration, Bluetooth interface, navigation, remote access system, audio system.;nissan_altima
06/30/2007;Tom E;I have loved Nissans for years but have never owned one until now. This car is awesome. The power is great. I went for the 3.5SE with the CVT and it is the best ride I have ever had. It looks so sleek with the black on black that I chose. Nissan blew the competition away with this redesign of the Altima. I have only had the car a little over a week but I know this is a car that will last me for many years to come. ;Push button start, CVT, steering wheel mounted audio controls, mirror mounted turn signals, pretty much everything... this car is great. ;nissan_altima
06/28/2007;Kyle;At first I was skeptical about the new Nissan but after test driving it, the car surprised me in many ways. I bought the 2.5 SL package and I love everything about it. It is a nice quality ride with great sound (if you get the Bose). It looks sharp and runs even sharper. I really have no complaints so far either. For a four door sedan, I've recieve many compliments for its sporty look and great looking interior. The new Nissan also gets great pick-up for a four-cylinder and has excellent gas mileage. Excellent choice of a car for the price.;"I love the SL package. The bluetooth, 6-disc CD changer, Sirius satellite radio, Bose sound, moonroof, dual climate control, heated seats, and leather are all pluses. CVT is also a cool feature along with the autostick or what I like to call, ""the cheap mans stick."" I also love the gas mileage.";nissan_altima
06/27/2007;Durell;I decided to wait 6 mos before writing a review of this car. Let's say that it's just ok for a daily driver. The v6 is advertised as having 270 hp, somehow I think that's not entirely true. The AC is lacking punch, The steering is ultra light, the handling even with SE trim is floaty, build quality is better than last gen but not by much, the brakes are pretty much dead if one must make a sudden stop from say 50 mph, lots of fade, the gas mileage is horrible even when taking it easy on the engine.;OK, there are some features that are pretty entertaining: IntelliKey, Bluetooth, XM radio, well not a feature but love it anyway. ;nissan_altima
06/27/2007;Rayd;You will not find an auto that looks better, more horse power, and overall good dynamics for the money. I can complain about things like the position of the emerg brake or the lack of lumbar support, but HEY at this pricepoint?!?;Design, inside and out, space for occupants, liquid silver color.;nissan_altima
06/24/2007;running1201;This car is exactly what you pay for: lots of room, great gas mileage, peppy engine, and great looks for a car at around $20k. I got the Premium Plus option and have everything I need without paying a fortune. Loading this baby up gets pricey real quick, and the 2.5 gets it done adequately, although it may sound a little loud with the windows down. The CVT is really smooth and takes some getting used to (can't notice the shifts). Great on the highway with ample power for passing.;Keyless entry/start. With alloys, SR, and dual exhaust, it looks really sporty.;nissan_altima
06/22/2007;ssd;"Love it! I went for the fully loaded SE model with tech package. I was deciding between the Lexus IS, Infiniti G35, Acura TL and the Altima blew them away, and for 10k less! The bluetooth is amazing. Using my cell phone through the car has perfect sound quality. No need to yell. The CVT is also impressive, power will never be a problem. The acceleration is so fast that I haven't even come close to flooring the gas pedal. One thing to note is that the CVT does ""hold"" the car when you let off the gas pedal. Similar feeling to when you have cruise control on and are driving down a hill. Only major gripe are the seats. Very stiff and uncomfortable, even with the lumbar support. ";Nav, bluetooth, back up camera, push button start. Blond two tone interior. 3.5 liter has great power.;nissan_altima
06/21/2007;GM;We have traded in our third Accord for the new 07 Altima. Very good driving impressions so far. It came with the SL package that included leather interior and moonroof along with other conveniences. Lot of storage area in the trunk. Although you need to get used to it, the CVT is something else. The 4 cyl. engine outperforms some 6 cylinders out there. Folks at Nissan did their homework well. Definitely, a car to drive.;CVT with manual mode, leather interior, interior/exterior design, leg room, keyless entry and start, sound system. optional all season floor mats.;nissan_altima
06/20/2007;Thomas;I sold my old car and went and bought the new Altima and let me tell you I was going to buy a Honda Accord but the Altima has that car ripped to shreds. The Altima has more room and you can get a navigation system on the base model. I got the 3.5 SE with the technology package and added the rear spoiler and fog lights and I love this car. If I am having a bad day at work it seems like when I get in my new car all my problems just go away.;I love the push button start and the keyless entry a big plus.;nissan_altima
06/19/2007;Black Pearl;Bought two weeks ago. Great ride so far. My dealer found one with Technology Pack w/XM with Manual so I went for it. Glad I did! Nav is great and so is phone system. Black on black is truly mean looking. Getting 24 mpg so far on country roads. Waiting for XM to Sirius converter cause Sirius is so much better than XM. Very happy I got the manual trans. Goes like a rocket! Car is roomy and seems solid and safe for my two kids. Car seats fit well. So far so good!;Manual trans, nav system, Bose sound, unreal power!;nissan_altima
06/17/2007;sandy;This car is FAST, drives extremely well, is high quality. If you want a G35 and can't afford it, this is the car for you. Very easy to use nav system, beautiful comfortable leather. I tried the Camry, Accord, Jetta and A4 and this was my top pick. The 6 spd manual is very easy to use with a light clutch, beautiful exterior design, lots of leg room front and rear, beats the competition hands down, from acceleration to interior design. If you want a fast (0-60 MPH 5.9 sec) and high quality (rivals G35 and Lexus), try this car before you make your decision. You will be impressed, drives like a much more expensive car than it is. Great road trip car, comfortable with little road noise. ;Power (270 HP 258 ft Tq), very fast, nav system, beautiful comfortable leather, reliability and quality, overall looks.;nissan_altima
06/13/2007;copdoc;This is my second Altima in four years. I love the style. The 2007 enhances on what could have been said was already perfect. Very luxurious and comfortable. ;"The navigation system - Bose radio is awesome!! Great GPS features and the best I have owned (three others to be exact). The Bose radio with XM radio ""kicks"" (my grandkids say). ";nissan_altima
06/13/2007;De;I researched all the mid-size sedans. I love the Infiniti G35, but opted for mpg over high performance. The Camry and Accord are too boring. The Altima looks better and the 2.5L CVT gets better mpg than the other two. I orginally wanted the 3.5, but drove the 2.5l and was impressed with its power! (I drove 5.3L v8 before.) I agree that to get some of the features I wanted I had to buy the SL and the Connection package to get the Bose and CD changer. But really for the price it is still affordable. ;I love the CVT and the new styling in and out. I got the blond leather and think it is very comfortable. I also love the aux audio input to plug in my iPod.;nissan_altima
06/11/2007;rps1;I picked up my Altima on 6/8 and I love it. The CVT is smooth and responsive.The ride is exceptionally smooth and comfortable. The interior in leather is luxurious along with the trim. The gas mileage is better than average, about the same as my '05 3.5 SL. The body style is sharp and quite a change. The metallic winter frost is different and rich. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the foot emergency brake.;Love the CVT, exterior style, Bose system and comfortable ride. Interior is rich and gauges and lighting are well placed.;nissan_altima
06/06/2007;Tony in Seattle;Got the 2.5 CVT with SL package a month ago and I can't help but smile everytime I drive it. The 2.5L engine is powerful and torquey for a 4 cyl and the CVT is smooth as silk. We love the leather, dual climate control, power seats, stereo and all the options you would find in lux cars, not to mention the styling! Nissan's power train is reliable and innovative. We expect to enjoy this car for years to come. (Still have our 94 Altima. After 200K and 13+ years, the engine still runs like a champ!);Push start and intelligent key (can't help but show it off to friends every chance we have);nissan_altima
06/06/2007;Christine;Traded a 2000 Altima SE for a 2007 2.5S with Convenience Plus pkg. I want to drive everywhere now. From its classy and streamlined style, roomy interior, to the powerful performance from the 4-cylinder CVT, I love this car. I didn't test drive the 6-cyl, it was over my budget, but the 4 has me merging into traffic with no problems. The CVT is buttery smooth. Interior storage and cup holders are plentiful, a huge advantage over my 2000. My BF and I find the firm seats supportive. Rear seat psgrs have great leg room. I love the pushbutton start and the push button entrance feature on the doors and trunk - no fumbling for keys. Getting 30 mpg so far. Love showing it off - very happy!;Intelligent key, CVT, covered interior storage and plentiful cup holders, comfortable interior, metallic interior styling, aux stereo jack for iPod.;nissan_altima
06/03/2007;Vince;You don't need to buy a 6 cylinder to have good acceleration and passing power. My 2.5L has quite the zip! And the gas mileage is amazing. It's sporty, spacious and affordable. I got the 2.5 S with the Convenience Plus package and added a spoiler. It's basically the SL package minus the leather trim and dual climate control. Other than that, it has everything you could possibly want!;CVT with optional manual shift, the rear tail lights and of course the push button start.;nissan_altima
06/01/2007;datunison;I have a 2007 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL. I could not be happier with my Altima! It has everything I wanted at a great price! The gas mileage is wonderful, especially with the way gas prices are right now! I get so many compliments on it! It drives so smooth! I go through at least 1 car per year, but I think I might keep this one for awhile. It is just the best one so far that I've owned. Definitely a keeper! If you are looking to buy an Altima, I would put it at the top of the list to check out. I love it!;I love the smooth ride and the fabulous gas mileage! I can get 510 miles off one tank of gas. The seating is so comfortable and everything is convenient. It has a lot of space in the trunk and also the glove box of all places! ;nissan_altima
05/31/2007;Robsails;Bought January 2007. Have only driven a thousand or so miles due to other travels, but the 4-cylinder engine is exceptionally well matched to the CVT transmission, giving it as much pull as a much larger engine. The bluetooth connection is the best I have ever heard; it almost completely cancels road noise for the listener and allows great range control for volume within the car. The seats are comfy for the short drives we have taken it on and our one highway trip averaged in the low 30s for mpg at 70+ mph. My experience with other new cars tells me this will increase as it the mechanical bits loosen up a little. She jumps off the starting line with an amazing amount of kick for a 4-cyl.;nissan_altima
05/31/2007;r. pfaff;We bought this car after almost getting a G35 and have never regretted the decision. At the limit cornering is not quite as good as the G35 (nor is the acceleration) but they are very close. The mileage is slightly better (we get about 24 mpg in combined city/highway driving on regular). For 5k less we are very happy with the car. I do like the interior of the G35 a bit better, but for the money it should be better.;1. Reliability. 2. Good mileage and excellent power. 3. Good looking exterior. 4. No torque steer. 5. CVT works very well. 6. Good handling for front wheel drive.;nissan_altima
05/29/2007;JFW in NJ;I've only had my new Altima for 3 days, but I'm in love already! For the money, it is a very smooth, quiet and luxurious ride. I find it very comfortable and fun to drive, and I was pleasantly surprised at the great pickup she has! I had to pass a slow moving truck going uphill this morning, and the car really kicked in! Great power for a 4 cyl. Anyone looking for a sedan should definitely give the Altima a shot.;I love the push-button start and the amount of extra storage space that's available in the front cabin. Plenty of room for CDs, maps, etc. The trunk space is also very accommodating.;nissan_altima
05/24/2007;Ben;Before this Altima, I had an Infiniti Q45 and I am glad I traded it in. This Altima has plenty of room, it performs on the road with plenty of power considering it has only a 4 cylinder engine. I get great gas mileage (22.5 mpg city driving: short trips, 5 miles or less). I love the keyless entry and start. I don't have to look for the keys to enter the car or start it. The only drawback I see is the engine noise when accelerating. I have had this for 5 months already, and I have not had any problems with it. I compared the Altima to the Camry and the Accord, and I consider you get more for your money with the Altima. I love the dual exaust pipes and the exterior look.;Keyless entry and start.;nissan_altima
05/24/2007;Jevon;I had an SUV for 15 years and I wanted to go to a sedan with good gas mileage and comfort and of course style. I researched quite a few cars and let me tell you the Altima is the best value for the price. I know there have been some reports that the seats were not comfortable. Well I just don't get it, the car seats are fine and not uncomfortable at all. The ride is great and the 4 cylinder is powerful. I'm not going to miss my old SUV at all. I just love the gas mileage I'm getting.;The new exterior design is beautiful and the interior is laid out perfectly. I love the radio controls on the steering wheel and the bluetooth is great. Quiet ride, nice handling. Intelligent key is great. Gas mileage. Sound system. Powerful 4 cylinder engine. Heated seats. 6 disc cd changer with aux output.;nissan_altima
05/24/2007;nissan driver;This is my first Nissan and I didn't know anyone that ever owned one. For that reason I was a little cautious before I bought it. I did much research and finally went for it.

05/22/2007;dd;I am very happy so far with this car. I formerly had a Toyota Corolla, so my standards were high for my new car. I was most interested in a reliable, good-handling, stylish car with lots of conveniences, and I seem to have found all these things. It is a beautiful car that makes me smile! (A caveat however -- I have only had the car for about 2 months, with 2K miles on it currently.) ;Keyless start, amazing and convenient! Looks - a real beauty inside and out. I enjoy driving it, w/ the CVT. All the extras - compass, moonroof, leather heated seats, power seat, stereo. I also like that 2 car seats can be latched onto the rear, and that the rear seat is big enough to accommodate.;nissan_altima
05/21/2007;Curt;We purchased this car for gas mileage and the fun factor. It delivers both. Our trips from Kansas to Texas deliver better than expected fuel economy and we like the 6-speed manual. We like the solid feel and little to no wind noise. Seat fabric and interior components feel of high quality. We are very happy with this car. ;Keyless ignition is great. The overall styling is attractive. Driver info center is useful. 6-speed transmission is fun to drive. Interior is well thought out.;nissan_altima

05/09/2007;ann;"Minus side: If you have spine, back, or neck problems, this is not the car for you. The seats are unbelievably hard, do not conform to the body and poorly designed headrests do not allow driver to sit straight & lean against the back of the seat. Even with power seat adjustments, this car is very uncomfortable, although it may not be a problem for younger folks without back problems who seem to be the majority favoring this car and its ""sporty"" drive. The headrests also present a safety issue because they are difficult to see around, increasing strain on the neck. On the plus side, it is a beautiful car with lots of power. It simply depends upon the individual and their priorities.";Exterior design, interior colors 175 hp.;nissan_altima
05/07/2007;Dolly;I am very excited about this my car and loook forward to driving it everyday. This is my third Altima and I do appreciate the upgraded features e.g. 6 airbags, low tire pressure and gas signals etc. ;My favorite feature is keyless. I have a baby and that makes my life much easier to enter the car with the baby and bags. I don't have to be searching for the key especially in bad weather. ;nissan_altima
05/06/2007;Derek;I've had the Altima 3.5 SE for 2 weeks and 400 miles. The engine is phenomenal and has very smooth acceleration, and while the CVT takes some getting used to, I like it better than a conventional transmission. The paint job was outstanding (and I'm a very picky guy). Fit and finish was excellent. I'm still on the fence with regard to the push button ignition. A true pleasure to drive.;Body style, powerful 6 cylinder engine, silky smooth CVT transmission. Keyless entry.;nissan_altima
05/05/2007;proud owner;I've had my 2.5 sl for almost a month. Wow, it's amazing! Definitely a headturner. The engine is very smooth and the styling is very beautiful. I was in the market for a Maxima, but when I saw the Altima's new design I had to pick that up instead. I never thought I'd be able to get so many features for the price! Some of the reviews say the seats are uncomfortable, I disagree, they're firm in a good way and supportive. The intelligent key is amazing and the metallic jade color is gorgeous. Did a lot of research and this is by far the best value!;Intelligent key, push start, CVT, leather seats, great standard sound system, dual climate control, heated seats.;nissan_altima
05/04/2007;Woodrow;Heater was defective and needed parts replaced. Leather seats are hard, stiff and terribly uncomfortable. CVT drive train and rack & pinion steering make the vehicle drive and handle very smooth, but gas mileage is somewhat disappointing (averaging only about 28 mpg in 2.5 four cylinder model). Audio has nice tone quality but the output is relatively low, unless you get the Bose system (which is pricey because it only comes in an electronics package with Satellite radio, Bluetooth, etc.). ;CVT.;nissan_altima
05/03/2007;Jaeger;This car provides an excellent blend of sport and luxury with a large helping of driving enjoyment. Great style inside and out and lots of space for people and cargo. They really nailed it. The only thing that might be a disappointment is if you really like the hunt-and-peck front end squirminess called torque steer. It is no longer available, even as an option.;That sweet and strong VQ motor. I am also getting really spoiled by all the tech stuff - nav, bluetooth, smartkey, etc.;nissan_altima
04/30/2007;johnski;Overall I'm very pleased with my 2007 Altima purchase. I went with a fully loaded 3.5 SE with navigation and everything. About the only gripe I have at this point with the car is how they disable some of the navigation / radio features when the car is moving and how there is not yet an iPod adapter available. The bose system is less than impressive but what do you expect. -=(;Looks, HID headlights, heated seats, navigation with backup camera, CVT, interior.;nissan_altima
04/26/2007;Dave;I've only had my Altima for about 3 weeks, but I already love it. The ride is firm, but not too harsh. It's comfortable and stylish. The Bluetooth feature is very cool. What I love about the car: the style, the performance and how well things seem to be laid out. What I don't love about the car: the stereo puts out too much bass, the gas mileage is less than I thought it'd be (I'm getting about 20 mpg), and the air conditioning is a bit weak. I've already had it in the shop due to a faulty fuel canister (leak). ;Bluetooth. Power everything. Huge trunk. Fun to drive. ;nissan_altima
04/20/2007;J.Short;I am so in love with my new Altima. I am a previous owner of the 05 Altima. I loved that one too but this one is a much better car. I went into the dealership just to look at the new Altima and three hours later I was driving my Midnight Blue Altima home. This car is aesthetically pleasing... so much that my neighbor went and bought the exact same color and style.;CVT, push button start, interior and dashboard features are very attractive.;nissan_altima
04/12/2007;Jeremyaz;"This six cyl. CVT launches like a rocket. Complete blast to drive, but the seat is physically uncomfortable. The build I purchased has no lumbar adjustment and my back constantly aches after 20 minutes or so of driving. I am 6'2"" and 220 pounds so my experience may be very different from others. My old 2000 CR-V had far more comfortable seats. Perhaps time will soften the foam. :) ";"Engine, tranny, engine, breaks, engine. This thing feels very much like an old Audi 5000S turbo I drove in the mid 90s. A tad of delay as the CVT ""stretches"" (I am untechnical. I just feel a lag as the engine winds up) and then BOOM, the car launches.";nissan_altima
04/11/2007;Mike;The car is a piece of art. Its performance overall is great, just as expected. The look of the car caught my eye and the interior stood up to my expectations. Overall it is the best car I have ever owned.;The power the car has is unreal for a luxury vehicle. It has the power to get up and get moving real quick with no shift-shock. It's amazing.;nissan_altima
04/11/2007;Kikuchiy0;Bought a 2.5 S with SL package, very happy. I thought about 3.5 SL pre- purchase, but when I drove the 2.5 it had plenty of power and the better fuel economy was attractive. Seats are very comfortable and the leather is nice, feels nicer than that in most cars. Interior design is intuitive and looks great. Bose stereo system sounds great too. Bluetooth connection to my cell phone is very convenient. Fuel economy averages about what I expected, roughly 28 mpg. The intellikey is awesome, no physical key. Never fumbling with keys is cool, and you can't really lock the fob in the car either (doors won't lock from the outside with the fob inside). Overall I'm very happy with this car.;Intellikey. Bose stereo system. Leather seats. Bluetooth connect. Moon roof.;nissan_altima
04/10/2007;Blair;I bought this car after trading in a 2001 GLE Altima that I had numerous issues with, purchased new. Still decided to give new Altima a try. Car is very cheap looking inside and not comfortable. I'm a average size female 5'5 and 125 lbs. The seats hurt on long distance trips. After 2 weeks I traded this car in.;Exterior and push start.;nissan_altima
04/07/2007;Justin;I had my 2007 Altima for 2 weeks now. I love the car a lot. For a 4 cylinder, it has a lot of muscle in it. I like that I can play my iPod in it, with the AUX feature in it. The seats are a little uncomfortable, but I got used to it after a while. I have the leather seats in my car, and I did not have that on my previous car. Overall, it's fun to drive, and I get a lot of compliments from strangers about the car.;Push button start, iPod auxiliary, and dual climate control.;nissan_altima
04/05/2007;Neels Van Wyk;As a previous Atima owner, 2003 model, I found the new 2007 Altima to be a large improvement on the former model in terms of style and performance. The CVT is innovative, although 19th century technology, it gives the car a smooth and quiet ride.;CVT and again, CVT.;nissan_altima
04/04/2007;bman2505;I purchased my 2.5 SL Sonoma Sunset with charcoal leather about a week ago. So far I love the car. The seats are firm but supportive and give a sporty feel. The 4 cylinder is very peppy and can keep up with many v6 cars. Have about 600 miles so far and I am getting 28-30 MPG on 80% highway and 20% city driving. I expect it to get even better after a few thousand miles.;Intelligent key, CVT, Interior improvements over 2006, peppy 4 cylinder.;nissan_altima
04/02/2007;waterbobber;Great car. Great head room and leg room for tall guys, much better than Honda or Toyota. It has a back seat that an adult can actually sit in with comfort. The 175 hp four cylinder performs as well as some V-6s and it is so quiet you don't know it's running at idle.;The head room, leg room, and mpg rating for a 175 hp sedan is unsurpassed by the competition. A tall guy can drive it without banging his head on the headliner and without his teeth in his knees.;nissan_altima
04/02/2007;Nissan Altima 3.5 SE;This car is definitely a challenge to all eurosport-type sedans. It definitely belongs to a bavarian autobahn, not NJ turnpike.;"Sport package: 17"" aggressivly formed alloys, sliding sunroof (just press, no hold open/close), CVT, acceleration, slick sophisticated shape, push button start, smart key, hard BMW-like sport suspension, tight steering, handling - torque steer gone, feels like rear-wheel-drive sports car. ";nissan_altima
04/02/2007;Greg;This is an excellent car for its price range. It is a good fit in size for a person 6'2. The fuel economy is good, 30-31, but not 35 as rated. Its standard safety features are a plus. The car is a little noisy on initial acceleration but is quiet at speed. Acceleration when driving at 55 mph, then passing is quiet and quick. The cvt transmission does not work as well when the engine and weather are both cold (below 30 degree weather) , the high revving before smoothing out made my daughter think it was defective. Heat and air fans are quiet and effective. Seating position and comfort are very good. Seeing around the headrest and rear visibility is a bit of a challenge at first drive. ;Styling, interior design, and not having to pull out the key remote to get into the trunk, doors and ignition is great when you get used to it. ;nissan_altima
04/01/2007;Retired Frogman;Steering assist, precise steering going down the road were the things I smiled about on test drive. I had to have it, traded in my 2001 Maxima, and I've been grinning ever since. This is a fun car to drive. Nary a rattle, fit, finish are excellent. Why pay more for a G35 and RWD. Torque steer is gone. I can't rate the 2007 highly enough.;Handling, steering, power, comfort, looks. Manual mode with CVT is great!;nissan_altima
03/31/2007;Mike;Just bought my first Nissan after looking at many midsize sedans. Really liked the new design of the Altima and for the money it comes with great features: push button start, keyless entry, CVT trans, steering audio controls and all the airbags. Drove a few other sedans, but the CVT 4 cyl really has the other companys 4 cyls beat, love the pick-up and sound of the engine. Noticed some bad blind spots in some other makes, no problems in the Altima. The layout of the interior is well thought out, everything is easy to reach. Have only had the car for 12 days but really love it. Went on one drive of over 150 miles and it rode very well. Drive a lot of mixed city/hwy and last fillup got 28 mpg.;CVT trans, steering wheel audio controls, moonroof, overall steering/ handling on the road, keyless entry and push button start, its so nice not to have to get out the keys!! ;nissan_altima
03/28/2007;Brian J. Braddock;I just traded my '07 Camry XLE for the Altima SE V-6 with premium and sport packages. It also has stability control known as VDC by Nissan. This is truly an awesome car, that provides a firm but controlled ride, lots of power, handling is superb as you might expect in he SE version. The Bose stereo is nice, but not as nice as the JBL synthesis I had in my '05 Avalon. The CVT transmission is nothing short of spectacular. there is a slight learning curve. The Nissan has a sportier interior than the Camry that was more luxurious. The leather is of a high quality. Gas mileage is just ok, but still acceptable. I am pleased with my decision and look forward to enjoy the ride.;CVT transmission, nice exhaust tone, Xenon lights, handling, gauges, leather quality, looks;nissan_altima
03/27/2007;Strick;I've written one review already after owning the car for a couple days. It's now been 2 months. I have to say overall not a bad car but having driven it 2000 miles now I am concerned about drift. Even with no winds the car tends to drift especially at higher speeds (65 plus). And the drift is sudden left or sudden right. Sometimes it can be quiet alarming. I've never owned another car that did this. Could be just mine. Going to the dealer next week to get suspension and steering looked at but be careful and pay attention to the test drive before buying and if you already bought like me then pay attention and get it looked at if needed;Pretty much everything about this car is great aside from the steering/suspension/drifting issue.;nissan_altima
03/23/2007;Frederic Gordon;Well here it is the end of March and i have 5500 miles on my car.What a great experience it has been.This 2007 Altima handles the road even better than i had expected a true pleasure to drive and own.;Everything;nissan_altima
03/15/2007;blknite99;This is my 3rd Nissan I really love them all. I still have my 2nd Nissan which is a truck. I would get another if and when they come out with another body style. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have some of the features that was install or come standard with the car is signal light in the side mirror, and the on star. Overall the car is a wonderful car. Drives very well on the highway and city. For a 4 cycle is has a lot of power. ;the keyless entry, headlight, and the newly redesigned rear lights.;nissan_altima
03/15/2007;Roman;Thank you Nissan for making the Altima available with a stick in all trim models. Especially now, that the Maxima does not come this way any longer. My SE M6 is a true pleasure to drive. Good power, awesome looks, decent interior. I was ready to buy the new Camry back in October, but someone convinced me to wait a week or two for the new Altima. And, boy, was it ever worth it! It is a beautiful car. Unlike the Camry or the aged Accord, the new Altima has FUN written all over. Thank you Nissan! I couldn't possibly find a better car for my middle-age crisis.;exterior design simply rocks;nissan_altima
03/15/2007;johnny D;Love the way the Altima 3.5 SE handles, cabin is very quiet at highway speeds, CVT Transmission is smooth , car is very quick, and handles great. A lot of car for the money, great job on redesigning the Altima ! ;The engine is great , with the Dual Exhaust, like the taillights and the hood design !;nissan_altima
03/14/2007;Sjones;"Within 3 weeks after buying my car, I stopped for gas. After refueling, the car would not start. I tried to contact the consumer affairs number in the owner's manual. They stop answering at 5 PM Eastern. I contacted the dealership where I purchased the car. They told me to call one closer to where my car had broken down. No they couldn't tell me where there was a closer dealership. They suggested I ""find a phone book."" Have you looked for a phone book along the interstate lately? They then informed me that I was ""on my own"" The next day, I contacted the consumer affairs people at 1-800-Nissan- 1. Confirmed that this is what I should expect.";Looks, gas mileage (my average since the day I bought it, including allowing it to run to warm up is 31.7 MPG);nissan_altima
03/12/2007;vlc78;There are many qualities that I enjoy about my Nissan Altima, but there are a few that I am not so crazy about. I will start with the positive qualities first. The 2007 altima's interior is very spacious. I also really enjoy the push button start.... The audio features sound great, and it looks much sportier than some of the other cars in its class. However, I do have some complaints about the car. The driver's seat is very uncomfortable after about 20-30 minutes of driving. I find that my back usually hurts after long trips. Also, today it was 70 degrees here and my inside temp. said it was 41! The check engine light comes on from time to time. ;spacious interior, push button start, exterior design ;nissan_altima
03/12/2007;English Rob...;Had my Altima in frost white for a week. Fully loaded with light leather, keeps it cooler in Florida when the sun's out. The CVT is great, sooo smoooth, you can't feel any gear change, and the engine has great power.It can catch you off guard if when you first pull away. The sat system is well, not bad to use, but has a large manual. You need to sit down with it for a while to understand it. Great ride, good sound with the Bose system and the back up camera is good if not a bit gimmicky, I still use my mirrors. 'Plenty' of space in the trunk, its quite deceiving when you look at it from outside.I'm very impressed with the whole car and I did look at quite a few and got the lowdown about them.;The CVT and engine, Bose system, trunk space, keyless/push button start - getting used to now! I'm happy with the gas mileage as before I had a Chevy Avalanche, it used gas like it was going out of style.;nissan_altima
03/10/2007;Bob;Had this car for a month, and can say the motor and the CVT work great, if not with a small lag when you power up. Nice leather, love the bose system, looks great outside.Great value for the money, like you were in a more expensive car, the interior is quite nice if a bit of work to keep clean, lots of nooks and cranys. ;The power train, bose system....;nissan_altima
03/09/2007;Dawn;This is our second Altima. We just traded in our 2002 with 93,000 miles and got the new 2.5S with the SL package. One word to describe it is: AWESOME!!! It is black w/ black leather interior. It drives like a dream with the CVT transmission. We have heated seats, bluetooth, XM, Bose sound system and much more! These are all of the perks of a much higher priced vehicle, in an Altima. We thought about Camry and Accord, but you just can't compare the features for the price and quality of this Nissan. If you haven't driven one, do so before you buy your next vehicle. You will be glad you gave Altima a chance! We love ours!;Bluetooth, XM, heated seats, Bose sound system.....too many to list!;nissan_altima
03/09/2007;KingPiper;I have had the car for about a month now and I love the performance. The CVT trans makes it accelerate like it is in one gear the whole time while you hit 70 mph. Nice smooth feel driving around town. The bump are noticeable but what do you expect from such a sport susp that will hug a corner like a smaller car. Car seats fit well in this model with the anchor. Every time I take off with my kid she says WhooOOO, my thought exactly.;The stereo is decent for a factory model. The keyless system is neat, 270 hp under your foot, option to manually shift gear and higher RPM the car, nice modern exterior looks, a definite head turner. ;nissan_altima
03/06/2007;Jb;Compared to Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion. Purchased Altima based on the number of options vs. price and first year of new style. Overall fun car to drive - CVT is great. You will not be disappointed!;CVT, 270HP, Sirius Satellite Radio, Look of Exterior ;nissan_altima
03/06/2007;johnny D;My wife and I considered a Camry SE , and a Honda EX , compared these makes to the Nissan Altima , and the Altima won hands down.

Sunroof was not working, so I was really down thinking I had to take it back to the dealer. After some reading I find out it just doesn't work like it should, and this is the gist of what I really hate about this car. Nothing is directly controlled. Everything from the ""pushbutton start"" to the sunroof and who knows what else, is just a signal being sent to a cpu to run a sequence to do the work. Had I known this, i'd never considered buying it. I told the salesperson I'd gladly pay more not to have the stupid electronic key thing. It's just an expensive trinket waiting to break. ";GOOD:CVT, looks, timing chain instead of belt. BAD: not enough room below to add all the bad like tire pressure monitor and can't replace the radio with an aftermarket. needs option not to have intelligent key and push button start. ;nissan_altima
03/02/2007;Larry;After reading a few reviews, I don't understand many of the complaints--this car is not so bad. We've had it for two months now, and it is a fun, stylish, well-performing car with lots of room. And we also have a C5 'vette and a Mustang GT to compare to. Handling and acceleration are very good, and noise level is better than the BMW 735 we had. Unfortunately the in-town gas mileage is about as bad as the GT, ~17 mpg--the 'vette gets 19-20! And the GT suspension is much less comfortable than the Altima. In comparison buying, it was impossible to get a Honda in the colors and options we wanted, Toyota doesn't have a V6+MT, and the others were too $$. Plus we got $2500 off MSRP. ;Great value, very good performance, quiet roomy interior, min. torque steer, smooth shifting 6MT, intelligent key, pleasant looking car.;nissan_altima
03/02/2007;Johnny D;My wife and I bought the Altima 3.5 SE, last week looked @ Honda Accord and Toyota Camry , did not think they could compare . The Altima CVT Transmission is smooth as silk , the ergonomics of the Altima is great , the 3.5 V-6 is quiet,but has a nice roar in the exhaust when taking off, the handling is also exceptional ! Good Job Nissan , this is our first Nissan , normally buy Toyota and Honda's , love the sound system to ! ;The dual exhaust roar, and the smooth transmission of the V-6 ! Also like the exterior !

03/01/2007;Jugdish;I almost bought a Maxima, but drove an Altima at the last minute and was sold. This car is a blast to drive with the CVT. The engine is very quiet and interior cabin noise is almost as quiet as my Lexus. The suspension is a bit firmer than I'm used to but not overbearing. I immediately traded in the stock tires for Michelin pilot exalto A/T's and noticed a huge difference in snow performance and a slight increase in ride comfort. I am also removing the crap bose speaker system (paper cones) for Orion. Don't really care for the placement of the front dash speakers, makes for an odd sound stage. Overall, for the money.......this is a great vehicle, way to go Nissan. ;CVT is fun to play with, keyless is the way to go, Navigation is more detailed and intuitive then my wife's 05 Lexus. High grade interior materials used throughout the cabin.;nissan_altima
03/01/2007;Kelly;I just got my 2007 Altima in January and so far I'm impressed. The interior and exterior is revamped from the older models and is really nice. ;Exterior styling, cup holders on side of front doors, glove compartment is huge, roominess, and keyless entry.;nissan_altima

02/26/2007;JohnnyL;I have the 3.5 SE, CVT with minimal options...actually almost none other than spoiler, mats, fog lights and kick plates. The 2007 is a vast improvement over the previous model in design and fit and finish. Body gaps are minimal. Interior materials seem to be a much higher quality. One reviewer mention big blind spots but must be using badly adjusted mirrors. Virtually no blind spots. Engine is smooth and can hit higher digits really fast. CVT is great and does a great job of moving to a lower ratio when you need the engine breaking. I'm glad I got this rather than the manual. Seats are firm which I like. My lower back doesn't ache after my hour long commute. Handles like a smaller car.;Engine, CVT, overall styling. Fit and finish...nice climate controls , big knobs easy to grasp with gloves.

02/26/2007;steven;"Love this car. This is my third nissan (sentra, and 200sx) and I'm glad I stuck with them. Having owned 2 others, I know how reliable and problem free they are. With the altima, you add to that styling, power, and exceptional comfort and room. But, at a much better price than a camry or accord. the CVT is amazing. It allows for a noticeable boost in power even at high speeds, but will also employ engine braking on steep slopes. The interior looks as if, well, nissan finally figured out how to design a car interior. And the ""intelligent key"" is quite impressive. Kind of makes the act of fumbling around for keys seem primitive. ";intelligent key, cvt, 4 wheel disk brakes, cvt, 8 speaker stereo, cvt, interior design, cvt, and large trunk.

I recently just found new features in the car. In the center counsel you can take out the cup holders and it is one big open section. It drives very nicely as well. It is a smooth drive i can feel the power. I always look down and im driving faster then it feels like im going. The transmission is very smooth and i think that is the best feature to have.;I love the transmission, and the way it feels. I also love the push button start.

06/16/2009;Frenzy;Bought my Altima about a year ago. LOVED this car all summer. It's quick, very light handling, and has very responsive breaks. But then it snowed. I live in rural central New York so we get some serious snow storms, I spent most of the winter in my apartment because the car was so bad. I have driven front wheel vehicles all my life and have never had a problem, even in storms when people with trucks didn't want to go out. On ice, however, this car is GREAT!!! Just not if there is more than a dusting of snow on the road. So if you live in a southern state or never leave a city up north you'll be fine. ;Performance (in warm weather);nissan_altima
06/12/2009;Mike;After 9 years in my 97 Maxima GLE, I thought I wanted an Acura TL or TSX, but the premium fuel requirement and stiff ride put me off. My dealer had a 2 yr. old red 2.5SL with blonde interior and I was sold. So far I really like it - lots of nice features - dual climate control, rear A/C vent, compass/autodimming/Homelink rear view mirror, manual shift mode, steering wheel audio controls. The on-center feel/highway tracking doesn't seem to be as good as the Maxima, but it drives very well. I miss the quality of the Bose stereo and the lateral support in the driver's seat during corners. Mileage is quite good so far and it pulls very strongly. Quite a chg from my wife's 2001 Altima GXE!!;Solid feel including closing the doors. Strong 4 banger. Sonoma Sunset Metallic is pretty! Lots of air bags.

As other reviewers have said there has been nothing but recall after annoying recall. I absolutely loved driving this car, but about 2 months ago, it started to just not feel right. Long story short, I just had to have the front breaks completely replaced (calipers, rotors, etc) and had to have a NEW TRANSMISSION installed. All was under warranty, but give me a break! I love the way Nissans look, and they are FUN to drive when they run correctly, but I will never own one again.

04/11/2009;Aaron;I bought this car used with 19K on it after cross shopping many other models. Great car for small family (< 3 kids). This car is a quick performer with a sportier ride than many competitors (e.g., Camry). I get better than advertised gas mileage with the manual when I am easy on the gas. The controls are logically laid out and easy to use. I like the keyless feature (it's even easy to replace the FOB battery), but HATE the FOB itself (see below). I have driven manual trans. cars for years and years, but this one is very difficult to drive smoothly, especially from 1st to 2nd. I suspect that the gear spacing is just poorly planned. With the exception of the FOB this is a great car!;V6 engine. Very good gas mileage. Availability of manual transmission in a 4 door sedan. Reasonable to insure for how powerful and fun to drive the car is.;nissan_altima
04/02/2009;Brian in Ohio;Let me first say, I get a new car about every 2 years, because I get bored easily. This car is everything I had hoped it would be. It is loaded with the 3.5SE, 270hp, leather, and navigation. It had 32k miles, but drives like brand new. The comfort is excellent, but could use a little softer seats. The performance is up there with the best. It competes with most BMW's, Mercedes, Jaguars and other high dollar vehicles. Braking is better than others have given credit. Handling on the SE is excellent. Controls/interior design is perfect for me. Overall this car is outstanding. I see keeping it in my driveway for a long time. Now my wife wants one after owning a loaded 06 Passat.;The navigation is user friendly. The Bose stereo is one of the best I have heard (and I have owned a lot of cars to compare too). This car is FAST (0-60 in 6.4 sec)!!!! The CVT transmission is smooth. The car has a solid feel and handling. Has a quiet ride. Classy and sporty in one package! ;nissan_altima
03/17/2009;Noel;I bought this car used with about 19,000 miles on it. I was really surprised at the power of the 2.5 liter 4 cylinder. It's much peppier than I would have expected. The gas mileage has been good too. I average around 23 in town and 34 on the highway. The brakes are really touchy and grabby though. I'm hoping that will change with new brake pads. Also the seats could be more comfortable, but I'm getting used to them. ;Push button start and keyless entry (although I keep accidentally setting off the alarm with the key in my pocket). ;nissan_altima
02/21/2007;SR3.5SE;We have always owned SE's (Nissan/Toyota), so typically we don't really consider non- SE models. May re-think this next time. When you initially drive the 07 Alt SE, you'll get an inital rush similiar to driving a Z. However, just like the Z, for the long-term make sure you really want to live with the sport-tuned (SE) model. It does indeed handle impressively, but not surprisingly it does not soak up bumps all that well on a less than smooth road. This is exacerbated by the very firm front seats. In other words, Nissan really took things to the limit. I suggest taking very long test drives before making your decision, particularly with the new CVT trans.;Sports car handling in a sedan. Roominess. Intelligent key. Z-ness (except for CVT). ;nissan_altima
02/18/2007;Bad-deal;I just bought. I drive to a friend place and want to come back home. I could not start the car. Tried and Tried finally pushing different buttons on remote key I was able to start the car. It was embarrassment and frustration. The car ride is ruff. I never seen a car so bad. I would want to return this car tomorrow. Ride is so bumpy my but can feel ever curve of the road. My Camry is smooth and takes the roughness of the road and gives me smooth ride. I am planning to return this car. I had 1999 Altima for brief time. The ride was good, I thought that I would get the same quality. Take a ride on side roads before you make investment.;Key entry.

02/17/2007;Bill F;"I have 1,100 miles on my 2.5 SL. Very powerful and fun to drive, but it does not get the rated mileage. I am 6'4"" and have plenty of room in the front seats. The back seat, however does not have a lot of headroom. The computer is not accurate as far as displaying the miles per gallon, but is a nice touch. I test drove the Camry (did not like it) and the Accord (close second). My only concern is whether it will hold it's resale value. There is more engine noise when the car is cold and when accelerating. Cruising is OK.";CVT, Push button start, intelligent key, sunroof, build quality. The interior looks great and is well laid out.

02/16/2007;Happy Buyer;I am a former Rental car manager. I had a different car everyday. I have driven everything from a Camry to Infiniti G35. My last car was a Honda Accord 04' Was totaled 3 weeks ago on the freeway because of three things. Black ice, Bad factory tires, no traction controlled. I am actually excited when I get in this car because you pay $24k for a car that is worth $38K. The CVT has constant power. Getting on a freeway 0-80 mph with no shifting in the trans is amazing. It handles like it is on rails. (cornering is good). The last model altima's I drove had a lot of torque steer. Nissan fixed that problem on this model. ;Rims, Key, CVT Transmission 270 hp;nissan_altima
02/14/2007;Brad;I just recently bought the 2007 Altima with the CVT..I got the SL package, Bose Stereo with Sirius, Rear Spoiler, splash guards, and ABS. Man this car is fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder it has some good pick up. I definitely recommend that you get the Bose stereo..The car I bought invoiced at $24,915 and paid $24,500..so I'm happy with that...and Pebble Beach exterior looks sharp with Black leather interior. ;CVT, Keyless Start, Bose, SL Package is loaded and not expensive;nissan_altima
02/11/2007;Ronald G.;This is my first purchase of a brand new car. I love everything about this car. The intelligent key is AWESOME! Door unlocks when you get within a certain range as does the trunk. The instrument panel is laid out very nicely and the instruments are very easy to use. Altimas are mainly known as being drove by a lot of women but the 07s look sporty enough for men to drive. The front is a cross between a Nissan Maxima and a 350 Z. Gives it an aggressive stance. The back end reminds you of a Lexus. Lots of room on the inside. Trunk is HUGE. The seats are very comfortable. Ride is very smooth. I jump in my car just to drive down the street because its so fun to drive. I HIGHLY recommend;Push Button start. Roomy. The sound system. Compartments hide any and everything you have in the car.;nissan_altima
02/11/2007;Abyss;After 3 weeks 07 Altima 3.5 SE has been a lot of fun to drive. Looks great inside and out. Great interior layout. I'm glad Nissan got rid of their childish scoped orange speedo/tach. However fit and finish still has some significant body gaps (granted its only been in production a few months). CVT isn't all that quick nor fuel efficient (average 20 mpg in mixed driving), what was the point in doing this? This car does not coast along (or even down large hills). Hopefully it will be reliable to makeup for this. Suspension is very stiff, you will feel every bump in the pavement. Also has HUGE blind spots (so does Camry SE) making highway merging difficult. ;Interior/Exterior Styling, strong V6, great steering/handling. Lots of gadgets, storage, and trunk space. Great Keyless entry system. ;nissan_altima

02/03/2007;Andy;I sold my 2001 Maxima for this car. The 2007 Altima SE V6 6-spd manual is an incredible sport sedan. It's slightly bigger than my '01 Maxima, has 50+ more horsepower than the '01 Maxima, was thousands cheaper, and gets better mileage. It's basically the fastest front wheel drive car you can buy. There are two exceptions... the Mazdaspeed 3 and the Acura TL Type S. The Mazda 3 is almost the same price and is smaller than a Civic. The Acura TL Spec B is a 38k machine and is only 0.1sec fast in the 0-60. The 6speed manual is taken right from the 350Z and is a dream. Motor Trend specs the 0-60 in 5.9 seconds... in a front wheel drive car! I get ~24mpg average and ~27-28 highway.;270 horses of fury and buttery smooth. 6 speed. Great instrument panel.

I was concerned when I purchased my Altima, because I had a maxima, and the power and the way it handled I really loved, and I didn't want to feel like I was taking a step down. But after driving my altima, I'm really in Love!! Great vehicle.;The push button start;nissan_altima
01/25/2007;Richard;A car you can be proud to own. Driving this car around gives you the feeling that you're a cut above the rest; cruising about town in style as opposed to the blending in with the monotony of other vanilla sedans these days. The car is beautiful on the outside and spacious and functional on the inside. In my opinion, Nissan has perfected the concept of the sports sedan with this car. ;nissan_altima

01/17/2007;MDS5254;I bought this car 2 days ago so take it for what its worth but I've been an altima owner for over 7 years now. I just traded my '00 Altima SE for this '07 Altima 2.5 S with the SL package. I really liked my first Altima but all I can say now is WOW!. What a difference. If the '00 Altima was the epitome of playing it safe, dependable, all around family sedan then the '07 is all those things but on super steroids. This car is awesome. I wanted something safe and that had seating for 2 adults and 3 children comfortably for those family times but that also had the get up and go and sporty look so as to be fun to drive. This Altima does it all and does it well. I couldn't be more satisfied;Stereo is absolutely awesome and thats just the factory unit. If you want boom this factory system will do it. I cant even imagine what the BOSE sounds like but I know this one will thump you hard. Features are so many I need a day off work just to play with everything.;nissan_altima

Also, there's a reason this 3.5 liter has been on the ""10 Best"" list for years now. I test drove the G6, Camry, and Accord before making my decision. All are fine cars, but the Altima is the total package! ";270 hp engine with super smooth CVT transmission. Intelligent Key, Bluetooth, exterior styling, BOSE Sound-system, Xenon head lights.

01/14/2007;Campcandle;After test driving the Mazda, Accord and Camry; a friend suggested we test drive the Maxima. We did not as not in our price range but drove the Altima instead and purchased the same evening. We were impressed with the sporty drive without the sporty price. The displays are easy on the eyes and controls easy to use. Love the intelligent key and the roomy interior was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend anyone to take for a test drive. ;nissan_altima
01/12/2007;trig;i have the 2.5 S with sl, tech, and abs pack. wanted an 07 g, but pmt made the budget too tight. this is a very solid compromise. interior materials are better than in past versions. though they kept the body style similar, there are a lot of little changes that make this a great looking vehicle. all my ratings were based on the features of the car...ie it's a 4 cylinder, but as far as four bangers go, excellent performance...and so on. i haven't broke it in yet, so gas mileage should improve. reliability has been constantly improved every year on this line, and based on the materials used inside, i think it will improve again this year. if not, i'm only in a 2-year lease, so no harm no foul.;styling. bluetooth. nav.;nissan_altima

The acceleration is great once the car is broken in, passing is easy and breaks are great. Love the push button start, everyone that sees it is like WOW just like a Lexus or Mercedes. Makes ya feel good. Only bad thing I would say is that the fuel economy is rated 22- 26. Window sticker says actual is more like 18-24. I'm getting 16.7mpg mixed driving.

Great breaks and smooth transmission. 270 HP!!;nissan_altima
01/10/2007;bigbearsfan;This is a great car. It is very close to Honda/Toyota levels of fit and finish. My 3.5SE has the Sport Package and an auto dimming mirror. The interior is nicely styled and the instrument cluster is very bright and easy to read with good radio and HVAC controls. The seats are well shaped though they are a little hard and don't offer a lumber adjustment. The ride and handling compromise is great; it handles very well without punishing you when you hit a bump. Overall, reliability should be on par with Honda/Toyota. This is a great contender in the midsize category. I highly recommend this car if you don't want to overspend on a Toyota or Honda;nissan_altima

After over 10 weeks of intense research in this category...I finally made up my mind to go for this ultimate beauty! Top Reasons why: 1) cvt transmission - no stress over timing belts like the ones in toyota/honda 2) More of a car vs price you pay - intelligent key, push start engine, stylish front panel + lot roomier than toyota/honda & above all slick exterior design (makes me feel like I'm driving G-35 OR Lexus IS) 3) Handling is very responsive...performance wise absolutely fantastic there's NO NEED for V6 engine. ;all of above;nissan_altima
02/23/2009;Don;"Have you ever had to push your ""new"" car out of the garage so it could be towed to the dealer? 23,000 miles and we have done it twice. Key fobs and push button start are junk. Recalled with less than 900 miles to ""remove"" noisy heat shield. CVT has never felt just right to me. Road noise is horrific. I would not suggest the purchase of this vehicle. The fuel mileage is extremely over rated, city and highway. ";Exterior styling and that is it at this point. ;nissan_altima
02/23/2009;br;I bought this car brand new at the beginning of 2008 however, I purchased the 2007 model. I have 29,000 miles on the vehicle and Nissan has had three recalls on the vehicle. This is important depending on where you live. I could not renew the cars registration until one of the recall issues had been taken care of in my state.

I have the 2.5 engine with CVT and get about 22 mpg around town and 35 mpg on open road. The CVT is a great invention because it allows small engines to provide power or economy, depending on driver demands. This is a ""drive by wire"" vehicle since the accelerator goes to the computer, not the engine speed. The 2.5 engine is adequate and uses regular gas so don't waste your money on the 3.5 engine that requires high test gas.

01/19/2009;Riffkid77;Car is great looking with the new style. Power is stolen by the CVT. Gas mileage is also extremely incorrect.

01/04/2009;stingray312;It is a good little car. It has good acceleration even with a 4 cyl. It is good looking and stylish. It does not get the gas mileage that the tags said, but I had already known that none of Nissan's vehicles get what the tags say. The paint chips easily and it rusts easily when the paint is chipped (keep a bottle of touch-up paint on hand). Plastic cowling on bottom of car makes it a pain to change the oil by yourself. The intelligent key and push button starting are great features (I have to keep my friends from playing with the door locks though).

12/17/2008;rayy;"Great car, but with the standard seats it's not comfortable on long trips--no lumbar support, and the head rest pushes your head forward in an awkward position. But I think that is typical of most cars nowadays. The tires typical of Nissan OEM tires only lasted about 36K miles. Great acceleration esp. considering mpg which is 27-28 on the highway. The main beef I had when buying this car was that you are forced into buying a $10K ""technology package"" if you want the nice stereo with Sirius radio. The standard stereo does have an mp3 jack which I use for my Sirius plug-in. Electronic key is great & prevents locking your keys in the trunk.";Electronic key.

Got 30 mpg on our road trip, expect better in warmer weather without reformulated gas. Seats are very comfortable for long trip.

10/20/2008;Steve;Just a word of warning for anyone wanting to keep the CVT Altima for any length of time. My CVT just imploded with 46,000 km on it. Maybe warranty they say, maybe not. Takes two days to do the paperwork to get the new transmission approved... if it gets approved. Not impressed. The car is very noisy when driving and lurches when going downhill. I will never buy another CVT again. I can only imagine the cost of replacement for this thing.

The paint started peeling off my bumper at 1,000 miles. I have had my brakes fixed 3 times for squeaking issues and the car only has 13,000 miles on it. If you have a problem don't waste your time trying to call Nissan Consumer Affairs, they don't return calls. I have owned many vehicles and this is by far the worst!

In addition to many smaller issues, we have had the transmission replaced, the exhaust pipes replaced, and the computer reprogrammed three times for a very rough idle.

We were looking for an inexpensive vehicle (under 20K). Looked @ Accord LX, slow acceleration and cheap looking interior. Camry CE wasn't much better. Nissan CVT is a smooth (excellent trans) and gives a feel of good acceleration. The car is a good combination of handling and comfort. It corners well, yet still has a smooth ride. The list for new was 24k we were able to get a used one with 5k miles for 16k.

I do see that the cruise control helps a lot with the mileage. Love the way the car looks and feels. Could handle a little bit better in the snow as we get lots in the Buffalo area, but it isn't that bad that I wouldn't drive it or don't feel safe. I tried many cars before I bought this, like the Accord/Civic, Jetta (which was my 2nd pick), Madza3, Impala, G6... wasn't looking for a certain size, just what I liked.

Am going out today to buy another fob for it, that intelligent system is awesome and the push button start.

Driving the 3.5 V6 was the clincher. I have had it for 18 months and 24,000 miles with no major complaints as far as reliability and drivetrain performance. It keeps up with anything off the line. After 30 mph, it really takes off. Use premium fuel or you will notince some slight hesitation in midrange RPM. Climbing long steep grades with the CVT is impressive when you're passing everything else on the road. A great car.";Push button start and keyless entry. Navigation and Bluetooth. Bose audio. Touch operated display screen, and steering wheel mounted controls. My highway mpg was 30 mpg @ a constant 80mph. Around town it's 23 mpg. I don't drive it hard unless I have to.;nissan_altima
06/12/2008;Brandon;Love the car, I never thought that I would own an Altima but when I saw the new body style I had to test drive it. Was planning on buying an 07 Toyota Camry S, but once I got into the Altima the power and push button start got me. Ended up with the white 3.5 SE w/6 speed. I always get compliments on the car. I drive the hell out of it and still get about 300 miles to a tank of gas. Overall it?s a great buy and would recommend it anyone!!;Love the CVT, great amount of power, good head room in the back seat, push button start and keyless entry, exhaust sounds great, and the six speed. Test drive it and you will see!;nissan_altima
06/10/2008;altimalady;This is the first time I've ever owned an import vehicle and I love it. I would never buy domestic again. My Altima is sporty looking, people stare all the time. Peppy and fun to drive. The 4 cylinder offers a lot of power and feels like a 6. I love everything about it. Huge trunk, great power and great appearance. Nissan really aced the revamp of the Altima!;Great power. Great fuel economy. ;nissan_altima
05/21/2008;Bry;This was the worst purchase we ever made. I personally have owned 27 cars in my lifetime so I am good judge of vehicles. Although it looks great and is pretty quick. This car got poor city mileage and had nothing but problems. Passenger air bag did not work for 8000 miles until seat was replaced, brakes kept locking up and left rear wheel was about to fall off the car. Then before we could take it in the front windows were activated by thunder during a storm and when we came out the next day the car had 1 inch of water inside and the dash, console, doors and seats were soaking wet, basically like flood damage. I would not buy this car ever again.;nissan_altima;nissan_altima
05/03/2008;Brittany;This is my first Nissan purchase and it will be my last. Two weeks after I purchased the car, I had to bring it to the dealership to have the battery replaced. A couple months later the service engine soon light came on and I had to bring it to the dealship. The car stayed in the shop all day only to find out they had to order fuel filler tube so I had to bring it in again! My paint is chipping, the electronic seat button on the drivers seat has fallen off, the arm rest on the interior of the car always pop out of place. This was a relatively low priced car, but these are things that should not go wrong in the first year of a cars life! Overall I'm not a happy camper!;I like the way the car handles.;nissan_altima
05/02/2008;jimbo;Most of my driving is around town. The fuel mileage I am getting is very disappointing. On average I drive 270 miles on 17 gallons of gas. The equates to 15/16 miles to the gallon. Whether I drive the car manual or automatic I get the same results. The manufacture states 23 miles around town. Highway I am not sure of. I bought the car thinking the milage around would be good. Disappointed.;The car has great acceleration for a 4cyl. The car looks great.;nissan_altima
04/28/2008;gogo;I traded in my 2000 Saab 93 convert. because it was just time. My wife has the Murano and we love it and I just needed something to get me to and from the train station everyday. This car has better pick up than my Saab and handles better overall. I used to drive 5 spd for many years so the +/- shift is fun to drive from time to time and I found it works great in the snow/ice to avoid breaking when going down hills. I went real basic on all the features and I don't feel like I am missing anything. The steering is a little loose compared to what I have been driving before (Saab 93 and VW GTI), but it is really a nice car inside and out!! The stereo is pretty good without the bose upgrade.;I love the keyless ignition and push button entry on the door handle!! This took some getting used to, but I'm not sure if I can ever live without it again. I just carry the key fob and use my garage door opener to get in the house. NO MORE KEYS!! The ipod AUX port and dual ac ports are an huge plus;nissan_altima
04/14/2008;hyjean888;Three days after purchasing this car, I was involved in an accident in which I did multiple 360s on an interstate going 80 mph and ended up spinning into and out of a 4 foot ditch twice, completely smashing in both the front end and the rear end. I was wearing my seatbelt, however my dog (in the passenger seat) was not (and did not have benefit of an airbag like I did)! My dog and I both walked out of the car with VERY minor bumps and bruises (mostly from the seatbelt and airbag). I'm so upset that I lost my Altima but I am definitely buying another one as soon as I can. This car saved my life (and my dog's life). The paramedics couldn't believe I survived and neither could I. Thanks Nissan!;Safety features saved my life. ;nissan_altima
04/11/2008;Ica;I do like my 2.5S Altima for the way that it looks on the outside. The design especially on the back is what led me to the dealer in the first place. The push key is fun as well. But that is all that is good inside, noise comes from everywhere! I feel like it is going to fall apart as I drive it. Oh and mine sounds like crap all day and I keep taking in to the dealer they say it is fixed some recall crap and then guess what I hear as I drive home? Ugh!;I am still vain about my Altima, it looks good. The push button is great. Reliable.;nissan_altima
04/10/2008;Lee;I bought my Altima to drive to work. My daughter drove it home for me it was an hour drive she fell in love with it and the next week purchased her own Altima from the same dealer. We really do love our Altima.;Keyless entry;nissan_altima
03/20/2008;Adele;Drove a 94 Thunderbird for 13 years and thought I wanted a car with a V6 engine. Tested a Ford Fusion V6 and the 4 cyl Camry. When I drove the 2.5S Altima I couldn't believe how strong and powerful the engine is. It can keep up with everything on the road. I love the gas mileage. It gets 35 mpg with all highway driving. With all city driving it gets about 22 mpg. The cvt is smooth and responsive and the car feels solid and sure on highways. The seats felt a little too firm at first but now I'm used to them. I'm very happy with this car and just love driving it.;The looks. The Smart Key. The design of the controls. Nice and easy to use.;nissan_altima
03/12/2008;Paul;A great car overall. Very powerful 3.5L engine. Drives great except in snow it's not very good. Lots of wheel spin, etc. Interior is well designed except no passenger power seat for $30k?? Strange. Good gas mileage at 24 in mixed highway/city driving. Push button and door sensors are wonderful... never take your keys out of your pocket. That really spoils you!;Push button start. Power--it MOVES (3.5L). Look of interior and exterior. Trunk space.;nissan_altima
03/11/2008;Mike;I went from a brand new 1999 Oldsmobile Alero to 2001 Lincon Navigator to a brand new 2004 Cadillac SRX to the latest brand new 2007 Nissan Altima. It's THE best car I've owned to date hands down!! No more expensive SUVs for me.;My fav's are the push button start and the amount of vehicle you get for the money... you cant beat it!;nissan_altima
03/10/2008;Siddharth Wartak;I was a Honda fan for many years and had Honda Accord. I thought of a change and was about to buy Camry. A friend's recommendation led me to consider the all new 07 Altima. I went for a test drive and in the first minute I was thrilled to drive the 2.5 S. The power, the pick up, smoothness and CVT. I had made up my mind before I could get down. Never ever have I a loved a car so much. I dont feel like getting out of my Nissan and I take longer route to reach home late. I drove 600 miles on highway with full tank averaging 34 miles/gallon. After driving the CVT tech, driving my friends conventional cars with freq jerks of gear shift are no more a pleasure even with V6.;Sporty look, smooth steering and ride, amazing power and pick up, keyless entry, fantastic mileage, don't feel like getting out of my car.;nissan_altima
03/04/2008;Me;Love this car. Good gas mileage. Nice to drive.;Exterior design.;nissan_altima
02/20/2008;Awsome!;I got my 3.5SE manual about a year ago. I love this car. I was a Honda fan before owning my first 05 Nissan Altima 3.5SE back in 04. Since I have owned this car, I have been in love with the styling. Great performance that comes instantly when you push on the gas. Smooth shifting, and pretty good fuel economy for 270 horsepower. The keyless start is another great option, as well as the lock and unlock feature that just requires the push of botton on the door handle. I put alot of miles on my cars and get sick of them quick, but I don't think I will get tired of this one anytime soon.;Amazing performance. Smooth shifting and a great design.;nissan_altima
02/03/2008;fcamp;Traded in '97 maxima for 07 Altima... what a car! Luxury, speed and affordability doesn't get much better! It will be a sad day when they no longer offer the manual transmission, that is what makes this car such a beast and fun to drive. It has seemingly endless power and pickup, scared sales rep on test drive and didnt even realize going 80-85 mph on highway... good stuff!!;Fully loaded....it's all good...Nissan is the only way to go;nissan_altima
01/27/2008;Jessica;Plain and simple, I do not like this car. Stereo speakers rattle like crazy. Random banging noises coming from all around the car when driving. Tires are crap and the car drifts and sways on the highway. Wind noise on highway is awful, I feel like I'm flying a plane. There is a big dent on my trunk for no reason that I know of, and that's probably because the trunk is made of complete tin and any little thing will dent it. CVT jerks and sounds funny especially it's the tiniest bit cold out. Interior side piece of the dash is warped and coming off. Dealer doesn't fix issues like they're supposed to. Sometimes I wish it would get totaled out so I could get a different car. Save yourself. RUN!;I like the push button start and the fact that I never really have to take my key out for any reason. The exterior DID look nice until the tin trunk got a dent for no reason. ;nissan_altima
01/22/2008;DJ;Was looking at the G35/37 to begin with. Took at look at the 3.5 SE with CVT and decided that for a lot less money, it was almost as much fun to drive. Mid range power is great. If you can afford all the bells and whistles, do it. Add the sport package like I did and you almost forget it's not the coupe! It's also way more stable in the snow and ice than the 2005 Volvo S40 I traded in for it!;Push button ignition, passing power, interior quality and exterior look (with sport package), heated seats warm up fast, audio system (Bose w/6 disc in dash/MP3) sounds great and the VDC works really well in the snow and ice.;nissan_altima
01/15/2008;Heat Shield;The 4 door 2.5 SL package gave me lots for my money. The only issue is with the loudly rattling heat shield in the engine compartment. Service tried to fix it once and the noise came back. A letter was sent from corporate Nissan informing me of their awareness of the problem and a promise of a solution in 60 days. That was early November and it's mid January. Service said a bulletin is out and its going in tomorrow. It looks great, but even better with an aftermarket window tint job. If they can work out the rattle, It will be one of the best cars I've owned.;Bluetooth capability, zone climate controls, heated seats, ;nissan_altima
01/15/2008;tom from Jersey;"I purchased a ""Program Car"" w/ 10,000 miles on it. Now after spending some time in it, here are some comments. Stereo in 2.5 S so-so , seems like CVT vibrates to about 40 mph. Feel it in the wheel and floor. They say 600 miles per tank full, I'm getting approx 510, this is all highway driving.";Push start, exterior looks, large gas tank 20 gal. Solid ride, quiet at highway cruising.;nissan_altima
01/07/2008;Marcos;I love my Altima. its a fun car to drive and very sporty looking. Even though its a 2.5 liter engine, its still has some heat. The gas mileage is great. I get compliments on the look of the car all the time. It's very well priced and it feels very luxurious. ;I love the push button start! I also like how the dash will tell you when your tire pressure it low, that was real convenient! ;nissan_altima
01/03/2008;Heather12;My husband and I originally shopped the Altima Coupe, but eventually let practicality win the day, and went with the sedan. We haven't regretted it for a moment. I have always been a die-hard American girl, and hated sedans with a passion. Until this car. With the exception of rear visibility being a little difficult, I don't even know I am driving a sedan. The handling of this car is amazing, and the CVT is my new best friend. The 3.5 SL has everything we looked for in other cars, and then some, and you can't beat the price. It has more power than I will ever need, and makes driving this car a joy. The IntelliKey system, with the push-button start, is pure genius!;Push button start, Bose audio, MP3 plug-in, IntelliKey. General interior styling is very smart and convenient. Trunk organizer with First Aid Kit and Emergency Road Kit a definite plus. Headlights and taillights are gorgeous (I prefer the sedan's taillights to the coupes!). Just a beautiful car!;nissan_altima
12/23/2007;Mike Witkowski;I had leased a 2005 Grand Prix. This ride is not quite as comfortable but it is more fun to drive. Went on 250 mile trip two weekends in a row. First week we took my wife's Prius. Nice mileage but not very quick. Taking the Altima the next weekend was much better. I am not totally sure that I that I did the right thing by not buying the Grand Prix which I was getting 24 mpg while I am getting the same with the Altima. Maybe when the engine gets more miles the mpg will increase.;The pick up for a 4 cylinder is fantastic. That is why I call it my pocket rocket.;nissan_altima
11/14/2007;LOU T. CHURCHVILLE;I recently bought an Altima after 30 years of American cars. This car is solid, quiet, fast, smooth and very good on gas. Nissan Altima is excellent!;Push button start rules!;nissan_altima
11/14/2007;wilhelmreems;So far the car has lived up to my expectations. I was looking at the Dodge Charger, Pontiac G6, Chevy Impala SS and this was the best one. Has the safety features that are optional on the other cars standard and the 6 cyl is well worth it. I average 27 miles to the gallon, mostly highway and don't need to step on the gas to get around people like a 4 cyl would. The car is great, but the service I've received from several dealers is lacking. Already had to fix the CV joint boot, there was a tear in it. It was under warranty. It has better gas mileage than the V8s I considered and it's just as fast b/c it's lighter. ;Push button start, dashboard display, heated seats, roomy interior, acceleration, head room, sun roof, just about everything.;nissan_altima
11/13/2007;Francisco Gamero;I have this Nissan Altima 2.5 for a month and 8 days and filled the gas tank for the third time, driving gently in the city and fwy combine my average MPG is 18.2 miles per gallon NOT 26-34 MPG as the sticker and salesman tells you. (I'm a 59 yr. old safe driver.) Love the transmission, is a quick car and fun to drive. They could do better with the inside... too much plastic. Seats are good but don't hug you. ;Transmission. I have 20 inch chrome wheels and look great.;nissan_altima
11/07/2007;Da Kings kid!!;I overworked my poor little 97 Nissan Sentra and needed to buy a new car. I actually was prepared to buy the new Camry, but then I walked into the Nissan dealer and saw the Radiant Silver Altima. Once I test drove it I was hooked! This is the only car I test drove that I didn't care whether it had a spoiler or a sunroof. And those 177 ponies under the hood make driving fun, especially on curves!!;The keyless entry and push button start! It is completely amazing that I never have to take my keys out of my handbag. The stereo is great too!!;nissan_altima
11/04/2007;2.5 SL;I have owned 8 Nissans over the last 12 years. Great reliability! This is one of the best values on the market. Great exterior styling. It looks much better than the other sedans in it's price point. With the CVT, you get good acceleration and good gas mileage. Get it in Super Black. ;CVT with manual shift option. Smart key with push button start. Push button lock and unlock on the door handles. ;nissan_altima
10/22/2007;RPS;My 2007 Altima 2.5SL w/CVT is fun to drive. With only 2000 miles on it, it is hard to speak about predicted reliability but if this car lasts like my 1999 Altima with over 200k miles, I will be very happy. The driver's cockpit area is well laid out with everything in easy reach and logical placement. I intended to get an entry level 2.5S but I was impressed with all the extra gadgets and glad I went for the extras.;The navigation system, Bose radio, dual climate control, and CVT top my list of favorite technology gadgets. ;nissan_altima
10/22/2007;Dustin;I must say when someone mentioned the Altima I never would have thought I would get one. I test drove the 3.5 SL and absolutely fell in love with it. More amenities than the Acuras and far cheaper. The bluetooth phone system, pushbutton start, and smart locks are great additions. You can't go wrong with this car, it is fast, comfortable, fun to drive, and if you need it as a family car it works great for that as well.;nissan_altima;nissan_altima
10/17/2007;McDan24;"It drives very smooth and is a nice ride, (nicer than the SE but Im sure it has to do with the stabilizer bars on the SL). I wish it had 18"" wheels but that would probably have been at the expense of some of the comfort in the ride. I also looked at an 08 Accord VG w/nav and the controls in the thing made me feel like I should have gotten training in the space shuttle. There were so many buttons and knobs everywhere it would have taken forever to learn. But, the Altima has all the same features but in simple easy to use arrangement on the dash. The nav system is easy to understand and well thought out instruments great car, good drive, all I would ever want or need.";Sound system is great. Bluetooth is very very handy and safe. Headlights and auto tint mirrors.;nissan_altima
10/16/2007;MK;I drive 130 miles to work, five days a week. When it was time for a new car, I wanted something roomy inside, fun to drive and good on gas. I purchased the smaller 2.5L engine for fuel economy. (I've got the CVT.) I added the SL package to beef up the interior as I'd be spending a lot of time in my car. The smaller engine puts out a surprising amount of power and makes the drive fun while the SL package interior looks great. Like a much more expensive car. The gas mileage is good considering I drive on a major highway at 72 mph on cruise for 90% of my miles. I get about 27 mpg. 14,000 miles in five months and the car is holding up great. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.;I am really impressed with the power of the smaller engine. It's powerful enough to accelerate quickly and pass when you need it. Fun! I also enjoy the keyless entry and start. It's nice to put the fob in your pocket and not worry about it.;nissan_altima
10/13/2007;Kristi;"I admit that I JUST got this car, but I just love it. I wanted a pretty inexpensive, reliable car so I went looking for the best price on either a base model Camry, Accord, or Altima. I was surprised by how much ""cheaper"" the base model Honda and Toyota felt vs. the Altima. I really felt like I was getting the value I wanted, but that the car still seemed to be of a higher level than the other two. Definitely the best bang for the buck.";CVT is fun. Love how great even the standard stereo sounds. Car is also very solid and quiet.;nissan_altima
10/12/2007;rich;The sole purpose for us buying the car was dependability and gas mileage. In to months we have yet to get either. Brakes glazed in a month, they don't know why. Rotors turned now brakes act funny. Never got any better then 25 mpg on straight highway driving, sticker said 35 mpg.;The radio has an aux plug, I guess that is cool and there is good trunk space, nice to look at.;nissan_altima
10/03/2007;Ken;My wife and I were looking for a new vehicle that got good gas mileage and had ample performance. We test drove Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans. The Altima was far and away the most fun to drive, had good gas mileage and surprising performance for a four cylinder. After over 4,500 miles including 1,000 mile trip the mpg on the road was averaging 34 and around town 27. We couldn't be happier with the car. ;Gas mileage, CVT and keyless operation.;nissan_altima
09/29/2007;deanh2nd;So this is probably one of the best cars on the market right now, no joke. I've had it for about 4 months and the car only gets better each day. The fuel economy has become better than the EPA estmates. Maybe it's my driving or perhaps it's the area, but the car is great on fuel. The CVT is a dream and so is the handling. If there is anything it could use is a little more engine refinement and a bit less grey inside, but otherwise it is almost the perfect car.;The Intelligent Key system with the pushbutton start. Also, the handling, the performance, the gauges, especially the trip computer, and all the compliments I get on it.;nissan_altima
09/27/2007;Jose;I was in the market looking for a new car and my choices were, Accord, Camry and Maxima. I loved the new Accord coming from a long time Honda owner as well as the Camry. I did drive the Camry and liked it, I tried the new accord and loved it. I was about to purchase it, then I told my wife let's try the Maxima. We liked the Maxima but the salesman said just try the 2007 Altima. Wow, I was impressed, the power and all around design just caught my attention. Nissan has stepped up on this model and I recommend you drive one for yourself. I love this Altima. ;Powerful engine. CVT. Interior design. Exterior design.;nissan_altima
09/20/2007;Stylez;This car is really surprising to me because I used to have a Maxima and it was nothing but a headache, not sure why but I must have picked the wrong one. Anyway this car has been great, it rides great and sound insulation is terrific. The CVT rocks I love it. I mean it's weird when you're driving a car with this power that you don't feel it shift. Still getting used to it though. I love the keyless part of this car. I never ever have to take my key out of my pocket. You can even lock and unlock the doors by pressing the button on the door. Truly keyless. Another thing is I think the seats are just fine. I don't know what some people are complaining about, they are comfortable to me. BUY IT. ;CVT, moonroof, keyless start and keyless entry through door handle, stereo with aux port, TPMS. Convenience package, alloy wheels, and gotta love the dual exhaust.;nissan_altima
09/16/2007;catstoy;After a Saturn and Eclipse in the 90s and SUVs and trucks over the last few years, I was unsure about moving back lower to the ground (still have our Titan, but will use it considerably less) and am delighted with the sporty feel of my new Altima. Feels solid and responsive. Very fun to drive!;"I love the design/aerodynamics. Other sedans I tried were ""nice"" and ""suitable"", but to find a sporty looking sedan that also drives comfortably... well, we just knew the Altima was ""it"".";nissan_altima
09/09/2007;TLC77014;Coming from a Nissan Sentra SE, I wanted something that was fun to drive, reliable, and technically advanced without paying for a BMW, Benz or Audi. I needed a gas saver yet something with more horses than my lawnmower. I test drove a V6 Altima then the 4. Honestly, I was amazed at how the 4 pulled out the lot and right onto a freeway on ramp. The only drawback to the 4 is the engine noise on take off however is quiets down after what used to be known as 3rd gear. I also looked at the Camry SE V6 and the Maxima. ;CVT, true keyless entry/exit and start stop. This car is loaded with features. I got the convenience plus package that added a sunroof. I also love the TPMS. I was able to quickly point out a leaking tire. Would be helpful if it told you the cold pressure as well as which tire was low.;nissan_altima
09/04/2007;Craig;I purchased my Altima last April 2007 and have over 9000 miles on the car. I considered the 3.5L model, but chose the extra MPG I could get with the 2.5L. There is adequate power with the 2.5 and I have never been underpowered in any situation. The select shift component is nice when having to accelerate without pushing the gas pedal to the floor to have the engine respond. The handling is great. The Altima kept my wife out an accident last week when an elderly woman pulled out in front of her on a highway. The car continued to handle while the ABS was working. Eyewitnesses asked about the car because they couldn't believe it. Strongly suggest buying one. Get the convenience package.;The ride at 75 mph is quiet and I feel I have positive control of the car. The convenience package with the sunroof and leather wrapped steering wheel add to the comfort of the car. ;nissan_altima
09/01/2007;Marco;Traded in my Mazda6s for a 2007 Altima with the SL package. Have not regretted at all. The car drives very nicely. Unfortunately all my trips are very short. I would love to spend more time in this car. Gas mileage is good, seats are comfortable, Bose stereo is incredible. I am so happy to be back with a Nissan. The Mazda was nice but too many little problems. I used to own before that a Nissan Altima 99. What a difference. The car has finally matured into an affordable luxury car.;Bose Stereo, styling, push button ignition, quiet engine and rear vents. Very cold a/c. Love that Nissan has always had great a/c.;nissan_altima
08/31/2007;Jim;Bought the 2.5SL package and love the leather seats and wood trim. This car balanced all my needs well: style, comfort, performance, economy and fun. My clients have felt comfortable in it. Seat was hard at first but either I or the seat adjusted (now at 5k miles). Standard radio sounds great but doesn't display artist. ABS grabby - feels like they are about to launch me through the windshield at every stop. I like all the room in the trunk, glove box, consoles and cabin. The wipers throw water back into their own way. CVT and spry engine makes it fun to drive, although it seems a little light in the front end under fast acceleration or hard braking. Feels pushed around by the wind, too. ;Smoothness of CVT, engine acceleration, interior and exterior styling, moonroof, keyless entry, leather seats and spacious cabin. Sound of standard radio. Good MPG but not great. Car is a lot of fun to drive, looks good and is easy to wash, too!;nissan_altima
08/27/2007;Ark Dan;I test drove Altima 4 and 6 cyl, Accord V-6, Mazda3 and Mazda6 with the V6. Owned a 2001 Accord V6 and loved it, except transmission issues. I've owned 1 four cyl and swore I would only drive at least a V6. That was 10 years ago and 6 new cars ago. Why the Altima won? The CVT is amazing. I never feel like it is underpowered because of the CVT. The engine does get a little loud when merging on highways, but is silent at cruise. I can accept the 10 seconds of engine noise for V6-like acceleration. The V6 seemed too jumpy. Handles great and is fun to drive. Very quiet and full of features. If you are a driver who likes a car with lots of features and is fun to drive. Check out Altima. ;CVT by far, Bose stereo and Bluetooth, keyless ignition and entry, huge glove box that's lighted when lights are on. Very well thought out storage design such as removable cup holders, console lid that slides for comfort, etc. Can roll windows down with key fob. Dual zone auto climate controls. ;nissan_altima
08/22/2007;Mz6GreyGhost;My wife purchased the Altima to replace her 2000 Neon. After driving everything else in its class, the Altima was her choice. The power from the 2.5L is impressive with either the 6-speed manual or CVT, and is plenty for merging in rush-hour traffic, while being smoother than most other 4-cyl cars. The interior is nicely styled and executed, with high-quality materials and excellent fit-and-finish (much better than the interior in my mothers '03 Altima). It rides and drives well, sportier than the Camry and Accord, but not as much as my Mazda6. The Convenience Plus package is well worth the price for the moonroof and alloy wheels alone. An excellent choice for a competent midsize sedan.;Intelligent Key may be a gimmick to some, but my wife likes it. Excellent gas mileage (better than the Neon), and the 20-gallon tank allows a 600+ mile range, excellent for high-mile commutes. The base stereo with single CD player is impressive. Lots of space for passengers, both front and rear. ;nissan_altima
08/20/2007;smc98m;"I had the '00 Maxima and bought the '07 Altima SE V6 CVT. I thought I was going to get another Maxima, but was sold after test driving the Altima. I wanted the V6 because I drive in Dallas city traffic and need the ""get-up-and-go"" speed from time to time. Let me just say the 270hp engine is fast, but is smooth and easy to control. You can't beat the CVT. I absolutely love the convenience of the Push Button On/Off feature. Talk about never having to fumble with your car keys again! As long as you have the key in your pocket then you can lock and unlock the car from the outside push button on the door handle. Get the '07 Altima... well worth it!";Push button On and Off;nissan_altima
08/16/2007;Mike;I was looking between the Camry and Altima. Altima is the right choice. I like the design and the technology used in the car, Smart key, dual exhausts, MPG, MPH, distance to empty, etc.;Smart key, dual exhausts, MPG, MPH, distance to empty.;nissan_altima
